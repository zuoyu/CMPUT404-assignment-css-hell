<p class="chapter"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></p>


<p>In the first edition of this book, issued in 1883, Mr. Anderson,
then Superintendent of the Belvidere Division of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, modestly disclaiming perfection
for his work, ventured the prediction that the science of
which he wrote would be greatly advanced as time went on.
In one sense this prediction has not been fulfilled. The
eight years which have passed have witnessed little or no
change from the principles then laid down by the author of
The Train Wire, but he has the satisfaction of now seeing
their widespread adoption and a consequent great improvement
in the practice of this important science; and while
probably none at the present time know how to handle
trains by telegraph better than the dispatchers of the
Pennsylvania road did when the prediction referred to was
made, the requisite knowledge and training are now possessed
by many more men than were numbered among the
experts of the earlier period.</p>

<p>The author's disavowal of exhaustive treatment is proper
in view of the fact that a complete treatise on the subject
would include much relating to the operation of the train
rules and to points of discipline; but it must be agreed that
the first edition of this book was the first thorough and
precise essay on the subject which had appeared, and that
it stated the principles of dispatching in substantially the
form since adopted by the General Time Convention, a
body composed of the General Managers and Superintendents
of practically all the important roads of the country
east of the Missouri River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">« vi »</a></span></p>

<p>The inception of this book resulted from the author's
work, several years earlier, in revising the rules of the company
under whom he was employed; and in preparing his
book he naturally took care not to trespass upon the prerogatives
of that company; but it is no more than right to
say that outside observers regard his work as one for which
his own road and all others are as much indebted to him as
he can be to any road.</p>

<p>During the preparation of the Rules on Train Dispatching,
formulated by the eminent Managers and Superintendents
composing the Time Convention Committee, Mr. Anderson
acted with that Committee, and his suggestions in The Train
Wire, with his other work in that line, were largely used as the
basis for this portion of the Time Convention rules. The
deviations in these rules from the lines laid down in the first
issue of The Train Wire are chiefly in the nature of compromises
as to methods of practice, made necessary to effect
an agreement among railroad officers of different needs
and opinions. The Standard Code avowedly falls short of
perfection, but chiefly because of this necessity.</p>

<p>The duplicate form of order is presented by Mr. Anderson
as a vital feature in the science of dispatching. When
he first wrote, this form of order was in use on few roads.
Many officers were ignorant of it, and most others knew of
it only in a vague way or looked upon it with disfavor as
impracticable for roads doing a heavy business. Now, the
requirement that all trains concerned in the execution of a
specific movement should receive the order in the same
words, is widely recognized as an axiom, and rules based on
this principle are fast coming into general use.</p>

<p>The first part of the book treats of general principles,
while the latter part takes up the rules which embody those
principles and give them effect, the Standard Code being
taken as the basis of the discussion. It might at first seem
unnecessary, in view of the wide acceptance of the Standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">« vii »</a></span>
Code, to enter into a discussion of its rules, and some
of this discussion may appear to be needless repetition of
matter presented in earlier pages; but as there are still those
who have not taken the most advanced position, and
probably many who, having adopted good practice, are not
thoroughly familiar with the reasons for it, the author has
done well to retain this feature of his earlier work, in connection
with the statement of principles. These comments
serve to point out to those not thoroughly
acquainted with the subject the relations of the rules to
the reasons for them, and this must be useful to beginners
in the science and to men on new roads. For officers of
experience, whose positions remove them from personal
contact with the telegraph work and yet require that they
have particular knowledge of it, a book of this kind should
be both elementary and full; and all readers will find in examining
the rules for practice that there is an advantage
in having attention directed to the conformity of the rules
with the principles before enunciated.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and original paragraphs in
the first edition of The Train Wire was that describing the
scheme for numbering switches and using those numbers
in train orders, to facilitate the movement of trains at
meeting-points. This plan has since been put in use
to some extent and has given great satisfaction; and
in connection with "lap-sidings" it has been found of
marked benefit in handling a heavy traffic on a single-track
road.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

on the Cleveland &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad was published in the <i>Railroad
Gazette</i> of December 26, 1890.</p></div>

<p>The author of The Train Wire is no longer connected
with the Operating Department,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and has undertaken this
revision reluctantly, but his interest in his former work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">« viii »</a></span>
is still lively, and this is an enlargement as well as a revision;
so that both reader and author are to be congratulated.
The superintendents and dispatchers, the operators
young and old, among the million railroaders of the United
States, have a better handbook than ever before, while the
author can justly take pride in the fact that the individual
views expressed by him in 1883 are now generally accepted
truth. The introduction of the Standard Code on 70,000
miles of American railroads is one of the important steps
of recent years in railroad operation, resulting in greater
security to life and property; and The Train Wire should
be credited with a liberal share of the honor of the reform.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</a></p>


<p>The views on train dispatching here offered have been
arrived at during an experience of some twenty years, including
a recent connection with the preparation of a set of
rules for the company on whose road the writer is employed.
While his agency in the formation of the rules referred to
accounts for the existence of a general similarity and no
radical difference between them and the present treatment
of the subject, the latter is not to be taken as an authorized
commentary upon those rules, but as an expression of
individual views for which, with any additional matter or
variations in arrangement, the writer is alone responsible.</p>

<p>With his first experiments in train dispatching the writer
became convinced that the method of issuing train orders
in the same words to all concerned in each transaction afforded
greater security than that supplied by any other
form of order. Another early conviction was that each
step in the process of preparing and issuing train orders
should be carefully and minutely arranged for by specific
rules.</p>

<p>In here undertaking to impress these views, it is also
sought to set forth the general principles upon which rules
should be based, and to recommend methods of procedure
for all ordinary practice. The methods proposed have been
tested by the writer, and the most of them by others. If
they are not found to apply to all existing circumstances,
they may at least serve as guides in devising other plans.</p>

<p>It is not assumed that this consideration of the subject of
train dispatching is exhaustive. The theme is a fruitful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">« x »</a></span>
one and of growing interest and importance. Much remains
to be said of what has already been accomplished,
and the future will doubtless show advances in this science
far beyond the best practice of the present.</p>

<p class="title">THE TRAIN WIRE.</p>



<hr class="r20">

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">TRAIN DISPATCHING.</p>


<p>The telegraph, as a means of directing the
movements of trains, is a necessary railroad
fixture. But for its agency the moving of the
heavy traffic of some of our railroads would be
impossible without large additions to the
tracks and consequent increase in the cost of
construction and transportation.</p>

<p>The train wire is thus a promoter of both
economy and facility of operation. Under the
supervision which it permits, the products of
industry are rapidly and cheaply exchanged
between distant points, while the traveler,
unimpeded by the slower-moving trains, goes
swiftly on his way. Steam is the noisy giant
that shoulders the load and gets the praise; but
the silent man, in some quiet place away from
the rattle of the wheels, with his finger on the
key, controls the ponderous and complicated
movements, which proceed so harmoniously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
that one may almost imagine them to be the
result of natural law.</p>

<p>Although the value, however, of the telegraph
as a railroad appliance is daily becoming
more fully realized, its capabilities for usefulness
have not been developed to an extent commensurate
with its importance. A well-informed
writer has justly said: "Telegraphy
as a handmaid of the railroad has not assumed
any enduring form peculiarly adapted to this
business."</p>

<p>This is still true in a measure, although not
to so great an extent as when uttered. The circumstances
must be very exceptional in which
the aid of the telegraph will not be of important
advantage. Machinery breaks, steam fails,
connections are late, storms and floods disturb
the roadway; a thousand things cause delays.
The difficulties may not be great or numerous
where trains are few, but they increase rapidly
with the growth of traffic, and vexatious delays
can only be avoided by adequate means of
promptly controlling the movements of the
trains. Hence the importance of securing not
only the best telegraphic appliances, but the
best method as well of rendering them useful
in the service in question.</p>

<p>In arranging a system of train dispatching,
its relations to safety and economy require that
careful consideration be given to the principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
on which it should be based. Some of the
methods in use indicate this careful study and
a growing sense of its importance is shown in
the recent general acceptance of rules on the
subject, prepared with the most scrupulous
care.</p>

<p>These rules, as will be seen, are in conformity
with what was urged in the former edition
of this work, and the present intention is to
direct attention anew to some of the underlying
principles, as well as to the practical bearing
of the rules referred to.</p>

<p>The means of instant communication afforded
by the introduction of the telegraph seemed
to place at command a method of directing
distant train movements with ready facility;
but it soon appeared that the use of the new
implement involved risks which must be carefully
guarded against; hence the various "systems"
which have arisen having this in view.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of the "American"
system of train dispatching is the issuing of
orders from a central office, directing train
movements, supplementary to those provided
for by the time-table and "train" rules. This
method is in general use, and is recognized as
better adapted to our circumstances than that
of moving trains by the "staff" or other
means from station to station, as in European
practice. In considering the application of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
this mode of issuing telegraphic orders for
single-track, some of the methods will be seen
to apply as well to roads having more than
one track.</p>

<p>A printed time-table, showing the regular
times and meeting-places of trains, may be
prepared at leisure and studied by all trainmen,
and is full notice as to all regular trains
on the road. With rules added directing how
the trains are to proceed with relation to each
other, understood by all alike and faithfully
observed, collisions cannot occur. If, however,
it becomes necessary to issue special orders for
trains that are not on the time-table, or for the
forwarding of any, otherwise than by the operation
of the ordinary rules, new precautions become
necessary.</p>

<p>The conductor or engineman receiving such an
order must know <i>that it is given by competent
authority</i>.</p>

<p>It must be understood <i>that others concerned
have corresponding orders</i>.</p>

<p>These orders should be <i>so clearly expressed
that they cannot be misunderstood</i>, and they
should be forwarded and delivered <i>under such
safeguards as to insure their certain and correct
reception by the proper persons</i>.</p>

<p>As these orders are to be acted upon at once,
without opportunity for careful study, <i>their
form, and even the paper on which they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
written, should be such that they may be
easily and quickly read and comprehended</i>.</p>

<p>It is now generally agreed that <i>orders of this
kind should be issued by a designated dispatcher</i>,
acting by the authority and in the
name of the superintendent. For two persons
to engage in this work at the same time for the
same piece of road involves serious risk, and to
insure safety as well as confidence on the part of
the trainmen this should never occur. It may be
taken as an initial principle that <i>the success of
a system depends largely upon the assurance
upon the part of the trainmen that every
source of danger has been carefully considered
and guarded against, and that the rules
adopted are strictly adhered to</i>. If it were
known, for instance, that orders were issued
by the superintendent and one of his assistants
alternately, as might be convenient at the moment,
it would excite distrust. The author
must confess to such feeling when, some years
since while on a delayed passenger train at a
way station, he saw the superintendent take a
bit of paper from his pocket and write against
the side of a building an order for the train to
proceed to a certain point, regardless of another
designated train. It came out all right,
but the incident did not inspire confidence
in the telegraphic system of that road.
Within the knowledge of the author a disastrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
collision resulted from an oversight in
regard to the delivery of an order where a skilful
official undertook to assist a dispatcher in an
emergency. Between the two an important
point was omitted; each thought the other had
attended to it. Extreme care is necessary to
carry out exactly the methods fixed upon for
the proper preparation and issuing of these
messages, and confusion is likely to result from
interference with those charged with this
duty.</p>

<p>In issuing a time-table in advance of the date
upon which it takes effect, means can readily
be used for making sure that it is received by
those who are to be governed by it. The
means are more complicated and subject to
greater risks whereby we can be assured that
a telegraphic train order reaches correctly and
surely the hands of those for whom it is designed.
After preparation by the Dispatcher
it is transmitted in telegraphic language by
mechanical agency to a distant point, there to
be retranslated into plain English and written
out without mistake, for record and delivery;
and all this in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The details of this process should be so arranged
as to guard as far as possible against
every risk arising under the several steps, and
<i>nothing should be left to mere personal care
that can be provided for by fixed methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
proceeding</i>. To one who is an expert and can
see in his own case no occasion for extraordinary
safeguards such precautions may not
seem important; but a consideration of the
risks involved, of the many steps to be taken,
and of the number of agents engaged in the
process, many of whom are often not greatly
experienced, must lead to the conclusion that
<i>a methodical following out of a carefully
prepared mode of proceeding</i> is a most valuable
means of providing against many of the
chances of failure.</p>

<p>Two general methods or "systems" of constructing
train orders are in use. They have
been distinguished as the "single order" and
"duplicate order" system. The latter is accurately
described by its title. The other
title is not a strictly accurate designation, but
sufficiently so for our purpose.</p>

<p>Although the "duplicate" method is now
widely recognized as the best, the other is still
in use. For purposes of comparison of these
methods we will take a telegraphic order providing
for the meeting of two trains at a designated
point beyond which the one has, by
train rules, the superior right of track as respects
the other. The order is to limit the superior
right, and permit the inferior train to
run to a point to which it could not otherwise
go without trespassing on the right of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
other. If by any error or misunderstanding
the superior train fails to stop at the proposed
meeting-point, while the other proceeds upon
the assumption that it will thus stop, the result
may be a disastrous collision.</p>

<p>Under the "<i>single order</i>" system, when
two opposing trains are to meet by special
order, arrangements are usually first made to
stop the superior train by a "holding order."
An order is then given forbidding it to go beyond
the designated point, and then another
order is given to the inferior train authorizing
it to go to that point. The holding order is
addressed to an agent or operator whose station
the superior train will pass, and reads
substantially as follows:</p>

<p><i>Hold train No. 5 for orders.</i></p>

<p>The person receiving this is required to display
a signal to stop the expected train if it
is not already at the station, and not to allow
it to proceed until the meeting-order is duly
forwarded and delivered. This order to the
superior train is usually addressed to the conductor
and engineman in the following form,
or its equivalent:</p>

<p><i>You will not pass Alton until train No. 4
arrives.</i></p>

<p>The corresponding order to the conductor
and engineman of the inferior train, sent to
some station to be passed by it, will read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>You will run to Alton regardless of train
No. 5.</i></p>

<p>or perhaps—</p>

<p><i>You will meet and pass train No. 5 at Alton.</i></p>

<p>The holding order is dispensed with by some,
and with some it is the practice to issue orders
to inferior trains while a superior is held by a
holding order until its movements can be determined
on, when it receives an order covering
all that have been given to trains against it.</p>

<p>Under the "<i>duplicate</i>" system the holding
order may be used, but such has not been the
general practice, and it would not under this
system be used in the manner above described.
This system, as its name implies, requires that
<i>the order given to each train shall be a duplicate
of that given to every other train</i> concerned
in the movement provided for in the order. For
the simple movement above described an order
is addressed to the conductor and engineman
of each of the two trains, <i>in the same words</i>,
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Trains No. 4 and No. 5 will meet at Alton.</i></p>

<p>This, being in the same words to each, may be
transmitted over the wire to both at the same
time. This is usually done, and offers one of
the chief advantages of this form of order.
The trains are stopped by signals, which are
required either to be displayed when an order
is sent, or to stand normally in position to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
stop trains, which are only permitted to pass
on the signal being changed or on getting proper
orders.</p>

<p>Objection has been made to the "duplicate"
form that it does not distinctly order a train to
proceed farther than its schedule rights permit,
nor in definite terms direct the other not
to go beyond the new meeting-point. The objection
has no weight, as an order to meet can
only be construed as authorizing each train to
go to the station named, and not beyond it
until both are there; and it is easy and proper
to provide a rule which shall definitely settle
the point for those who are unaccustomed to
this form, if it should be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>The fatal defect in the "single order" system
is that the orders to the two trains, written
separately and differently expressed, are subject
to the grave danger of inadvertently giving
in one a meeting-place different from that
given in the other. This liability is greater
if an interval of time occurs between the preparation
of the two. The risk is very much
increased by the usage under this system of
including several meeting-points in one order,
and becomes still more serious if meeting-points
are to be made for several trains moving in
each direction. The schedule for these must
be rapidly made up and written out in parts,
giving to each train its part, differing in form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
from all the others. There is nothing but the
care and skill of the Dispatcher to prevent the
opposing orders from differing in some particular.
When we consider the care necessary
in preparing a time-table, to properly show the
running time and meeting-places of the several
trains, we must see that the risk, in the process
described, of getting something wrong, must
far outweigh any supposed convenience in a
train having an order showing a continuous
schedule of its meeting-points for several opposing
trains. Those unacquainted with this work
would be astonished at the extent to which the
skill of some dispatchers in this direction has
been developed. To the uninitiated the mental
operations would be simply bewildering,
which are required of a brain from which issue
for hours, without apparent effort, the instructions
under which the trains on a busy road
are moved expeditiously and harmoniously.
It is not to be denied that many men have
moved traffic of huge dimensions safely and
with entire satisfaction by the "single order,"
but this does not at all prove that the system
possesses inherent principles of safety. Great
personal ability and skill have, with it, achieved
marked success where in less able hands its
defects would have become apparent; but that
some have developed this remarkable ability
is no reason why we should depend upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
in a matter of such vital importance. The
prevalence of methods which require exceptional
skill has doubtless interfered with the
more extended usefulness of the railroad telegraph
which would probably have resulted
under a system more readily operated by men
of less experience and ability.</p>

<p>Men who have successfully worked under
the "single order" method have stated that the
mental strain is very great, augmented by anxiety
born of the fact that a single error may
be fatal to property or life. Now, a mode of
constructing orders which may be operated
with safety by men of moderate skill, which
relieves them of the mental strain, and <i>which
in itself provides against the most serious
chance of error</i> must at once commend itself.
The "duplicate" would appear to meet these
requirements; and that such is the case is the
abundant testimony of those who have used it.</p>

<p>In preparing this order the Dispatcher cannot
possibly give different meeting-points, as
there is but one message for both trains, and
when transmitted to both simultaneously each
must get the same as the other. The mental
anxiety arising from the other method is
absent in this. An experienced Dispatcher
under the "single" system has stated that
in visiting an office where the "duplicate"
was used he was surprised that those engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
there appeared to have so little on their minds.
He found, on himself adopting the "duplicate,"
that it was readily explained. Each
transaction is at once complete. On the preparation
and transmission of the order in precisely
the same language to both trains, and
with no necessary connection with any other
transaction, the mind is at once prepared to
dismiss that and go on to the next. In the
transmission of two separate orders for the one
meeting, there is ever the feeling that an error
may be or may have been committed. But
where the one sentence is prepared for both
trains and, as is usually done, transmitted to
both at one sending, the Dispatcher may rest
secure that <i>no collision can occur from any
oversight of his in preparing the orders</i>, and
superintending officers may, if necessary,
commit this work to comparatively unskilled
hands, with the assurance that so long as the
prescribed methods are adhered to the proceeding
will be <i>at least safe</i>, however great
may be the delays arising from unskilful
movements.</p>

<p>The power of combination and of quickly
calculating the probable movements of trains
and determining what shall be done is an entirely
distinct matter. This power is largely
the result of experience. It is essential to the
full development of any system, but is exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
with much greater facility under the
relief which the "duplicate" affords, it
has been alleged that this method requires
more telegraphing than the other, and that
trains cannot be moved by it so promptly.
It has, however, been for many years in use
on roads where only the most expeditious
methods would serve; and superintendents
moving a heavy traffic, who have changed from
the "single" to the "duplicate" state that
the amount of telegraphing is reduced one-third.
Those who have grown up with a system
may have reasonable hesitation as to
making a change. It is not easy to give up
methods of practice in which one has been
trained for those which are new; and it may
seem difficult, perhaps unsafe, to undertake to
re-educate operators and trainmen in so critical
a matter. Nevertheless, those who have tried
it have found these supposed difficulties to
quickly vanish, and have discovered the result
to be in every way satisfactory, and that this
form of order is much to be preferred. Some
officers who were with difficulty induced to
change are now among the most enthusiastic
supporters of the "duplicate" method.</p>

<p>In arranging for the issuing of train orders,
experience has shown that forms may be simplified
and improved methods adopted by
which the work is facilitated and the orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
rendered clearer to those receiving them; and
disaster has taught the necessity for precautions
not before thought of. These points will
be considered in detail with reference to the
"duplicate" system of orders, although much
that follows will apply to the other.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE DISPATCHER.</p>


<p>The Train Dispatcher holds a most important
position as respects safety of life and
property. He may perhaps do more than any
other official to secure it by care or endanger
it by lack of vigilance. His relations to economy,
too, are important. As the time of
engines, cars, and employés, and of the persons
and things carried, is of value, delay avoided
is money saved.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that
the man who issues train orders should make
it his especial business, and should have no
interference from others. None but a very
limited business will warrant the performance
of this duty by the superintendent in person,
or by any one engaged in other work. If it is
such as to call for any approach to continuous
attention, persons must be specially assigned
to it. The hours of duty and the question of
other occupation must depend upon the frequency
and constancy of the demands of the
work specially in hand. Upon a busy road
where the trains are run much on orders, safety
as well as efficiency will be best promoted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
excluding other occupation and anything
which may distract the attention of the "Train
Runner," and under these circumstances a
period of duty of eight hours is as long as can
prudently be assigned. This conveniently divides
the twenty-four hours between three
men, and does not overtax them. With lighter
duties a longer time may be admissible. With
very heavy work, six hours may be long
enough.</p>

<p>The importance of confining the work of
dispatching, for the time being, to the individual
charged with this duty, has already
been referred to, and cannot be too strongly
urged. The office where this work is done
should be separate from others, and should not
be subjected to the visits and conversation of
outsiders or of employés whose business does
not call them there. The Dispatcher should
be a proficient operator. He may not himself
transmit his orders, but he should be able to
read all that passes on the wire, in order
to have an intelligent understanding of
what is going on. He should be thoroughly
acquainted with the location and length of
the various sidings, the grades and curves,
the capacity of the engines, and other matters
which may affect the movements of the trains
he has in hand, and some experience as conductor
will be of value. He should be a man of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
more than average ability, of good judgment,
clear head, and strictly temperate habits.
In many cases the chief Dispatcher is the
right-hand man of the superintendent in all
matters associated with the management of the
trains; and a suitable recognition of the importance
of the position will have a valuable
effect in elevating the character of this service
and in promoting its efficiency.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a><br><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span></p>




<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE OPERATOR.</p>


<p>Where the work of the Dispatcher is considerable,
he will require the aid of one or more
operators in the work connected with the transmission
of orders. In view of the importance
of his duties and of the fact that he may in
turn become Dispatcher, the operator should
be selected with care. He too should have a
clear head and correct habits, be a good pen-man,
an expert telegrapher and a sound-reader.
It will be his duty to transmit the orders, or
write them down as transmitted by the Dispatcher,
and to follow them through the subsequent
steps until the process, up to delivery,
is complete. He should not be charged with
message or clerical work where it may interfere
with his principal duty.</p>

<p>The station operator who receives the orders
must also have part in the subsequent steps,
and on him is placed the duty of delivery.
Besides the personal and professional qualifications
required for the other, he should, with
him, be thoroughly conversant with the rules
and methods prescribed for this service, as well
as with the time-tables and general train rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
and the character and designations of the
trains. A station operator may do much to keep
business moving by advising the Dispatcher of
arrivals, delays, and other things occurring
near him, which have a bearing on train movements,
but which the letter of his instructions
may not require him to report. One who does
this intelligently prepares and recommends
himself for advancement.</p>

<p>It is quite important that operators be impressed
with the gravity of the work in hand.
Their apprenticeship and training should be
such as to assure this as far as possible, and
before appointment they should be thoroughly
examined as to their qualifications in all respects,
and afterward constantly supervised by
competent officials. Young persons readily
learn to telegraph, and the lowest compensation
paid is something considerable to the
youth just leaving home, while the salaries
usually paid to railroad operators are not such
as to offer fair inducement to men of years and
experience to accept or retain these positions.
Hence many of our operators are comparatively
young. It is no disparagement to them
to say that they have not ordinarily the steadiness
of character and sense of responsibility
which we expect in maturer years. Without
these it is difficult for them to have a proper
conception of the magnitude of the interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
dependent on their attention to their duties,
and of the importance of exactly carrying out
details which to them may seem almost trivial.
We have here a cogent reason for so systematizing
this business as to render the working of
it as nearly automatic or mechanical as possible,
and thus eliminate as far as practicable
the risk arising from the deficiencies of the
human agency. In all systems worked by man
this risk will be found. Better pay will procure
better men, greater care and greater conscientiousness.
Men laboring for a bare pittance
and with little hope of advancement in
the future do not usually cultivate these qualities
to the highest point. Thus we are brought
to one of the many points where the balance
must be constantly sought between economy
of expenditure and security of management.
Each railroad officer must work it out for himself.</p>

<p>Operators should aim at a high standard of
qualification and attention to duty. If the
result is not greater remuneration in this
service, their efforts may be rewarded by promotion
in other directions. Reliable men are
always wanted, and the consciousness of doing
one's best is a source of satisfaction of more
value than money. A careful study of their
special work will develop a sense of its importance,
leading to better attention to duties and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
preparation for advancement. Operators will
therefore do well to make themselves masters
of their business, rather than rest satisfied
with a merely mechanical attention to prescribed
methods, without an intelligent apprehension
of their significance.</p>

<p>Telegraph offices should be carefully guarded
against the intrusion of outsiders or employés
off duty. Conversation or other interruptions
may distract the attention at a critical moment
and cause an operator to write an order incorrectly
or allow a train to pass which he should
stop.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE ORDER.</p>


<p>There are some general considerations which
it is important to bear in mind in the preparation
and issuing of train orders. Some of
these have been already pointed out. The
circumstances under which they are to be
acted upon render it of the utmost importance
that there shall be nothing in their form
or matter to obstruct in any way a clear and
prompt comprehension of their intent. <i>No
instructions should be included that are not
strictly running orders.</i> Directions to take on
or put off cars, or to change engines, or general
instructions as to the management and stops
of a train with reference to its traffic, are not
properly included in such orders. Again,
<i>the language in which the orders are expressed
should be simple and unmistakable</i>.
Simplicity implies brevity. Superfluous
words or ambiguous terms or expressions
should be carefully excluded. To avoid the
use of anything of this character the precise
form of expression should be determined on
beforehand for all cases that can be anticipated,
and strictly adhered to. This also renders the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
work of the Dispatchers uniform, and enables
them to perform it with facility, especially if
not greatly experienced; and the trainmen
become accustomed to the forms, and comprehend
them at sight.</p>

<p>There are differences of opinion among practical
men as to the propriety of including more
than one transaction in the same order. Some
reasons have been before urged against this
practice. As men generally favor the practice
to which they are accustomed, it is not easy to
settle this question. A number of meeting-points
may be given in succession in one order
more readily in the "single order" system than
in the other; and this is claimed as an advantage,
and as better than giving the same on as
many different pieces of paper. With an order,
hastily and perhaps poorly and closely written
on flimsy paper, to be read by a conductor in
a storm or by the dim light of a hand-lamp,
there is a good deal of risk that in a long
order for several meeting-points something
may escape notice; a line may be skipped
and a meeting-point missed. In the "duplicate"
order the same danger would exist,
and, in addition to the matter affecting
the train receiving an order, it would get
matter not at all affecting it. Thus, if A is
ordered to meet B, and B to meet C, and both
orders are included in one for the benefit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
B, the duplicate to A would include matter for
C in which A has no concern, and that to C
would have matter for A which he does not
require. Circumstances might make it of some
use for A to know where C is to meet B; but
burdening the order with this extraneous matter
will be found usually to be a positive disadvantage
and to cause much more work in
transmission than giving each operation singly.
The latter has been found to work entirely
well in practice, and is theoretically the safer
method. The conductor or engineman holding
several of these orders arranges them in their
proper succession, and each one as it is fulfilled
is laid aside. It may be desired to
change a meeting-place ordered, and, if this is
included in an order containing several others,
the change is not so readily made. The reasons
would appear to be important for insisting
<i>that each order should be ordinarily confined
to a single transaction</i>, with slight
exceptions, some of which are elsewhere adverted
to.</p>

<p>The following is a sample of "duplicate"
order actually and frequently given in practice
on one of the principal divisions of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. It is given to illustrate
perhaps the least objectionable method of
combining several movements in one order.
It is compact, and is alleged to serve a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
purpose. The principal objections to it are
those above given.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>

<p>An order <i>must not be taken to allow more
than it expressly authorizes</i>. As, for instance,
a train authorized by order to run in the time
of another is not on this account to assume that
it may run within the time of any other superior
train which may be understood to have to
keep out of the way of the train whose right
is curtailed. Each train must be governed in
all respects by train rules with relation to every
other train, excepting as distinctly provided
in the special orders; and as a necessary consequence
of this, <i>no train should be permitted
to run under the authority or protection of
an order given to another</i>.</p>

<p>Every provision in an order should be held
to be <i>in force indefinitely until fulfilled or
annulled, or expired by some limitation in
the order or in the rules</i>. In the orders delivered
to those who are to execute them
<i>no erasures, alterations, or interlineations
should be permitted</i>. These tend to obscure
the meaning and raise doubts as to accuracy.
The writing should be clear and plain, the
letters well formed and without flourishes.
Orders must often be read in dim light or in
storms, and when men are hurried, and they
should not be required to decipher bad writing.
Many orders have come under the author's
notice which were defective in this respect.
The following specimen is given, omitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
names that would indicate where it was issued.
The bad writing, the number of points covered
by the order, the difficulty arising from these,
and the flimsy character of the paper must
condemn the order as utterly unfit as a reliance
for the safety of life and property dependent
upon its proper execution. The illustration
is not wholly satisfactory, for the reproduction
of the order on smooth, white paper
does not adequately represent the indistinctness
arising from yellow paper, thin and
crumpled, on which it was written, in common
with so many train orders.</p>

<p>Orders should be identified by <i>consecutive
numbers</i>, as is now usual. If the regular
business requires a large number it is better
to begin with No. 1 each day. As a precaution
against the engineman overlooking
orders, and as a means for properly taking
care of them, <i>a clip should be provided
for them on the engine, in a position to be
readily seen by the engineman while attending
to his duties</i>. This will avoid the necessity
of his putting the orders where he may forget
them; and <i>with each on a separate paper</i> they
may be arranged in proper succession and removed
as executed, leaving always before the
eye the next to be executed. The copies of
orders retained by operators should remain in
the book. These books and the copies that
have been used by trainmen should be sent to
headquarters for inspection. This will serve
to indicate the manner in which the regulations
are carried out, and the condition, as to legibility,
etc., in which the orders are issued.</p>

<p>Forms of orders will be considered under
"Forms."</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE MANIFOLD.</p>


<p>Under the common practice there must be
prepared at least three copies of each train
order received for delivery. The conductor
and engineman are each supplied with a copy,
and the operator retains one. To make three
several copies by pen and ink, as heretofore
practiced by some, takes a good deal of time, and
there is danger that they may not be all alike,
and the time and risk are increased if more
than three copies are required. To obviate
this, the manifold system of writing has come
into general use and with very great advantage.
As used by many, however, it has serious
defects. The tissue paper frequently used
is very objectionable, especially the yellow variety.
Messages written on it are quite difficult
to read, especially in a poor light; it is
easily crumpled, rendering it still more indistinct;
it is difficult to handle in the wind, and
it is easily damaged by wet. In the use of the
manifold for some seventeen years the author
found it entirely practicable to use an opaque
white paper, of sufficient body to be free from
the above objections and yet capable of giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
seven distinct copies with a good pencil of the
hardness of No. 4 Faber. This is now recognized
as the best and is prescribed in the specifications
connected with the Time Convention
rules.</p>

<p>Operators should not be permitted to receive
orders on separate slips and copy them on the
manifold, but should take the order down at
once in the manifold-book. A sheet of tin placed
in the book enables them to make all the copies
perfectly distinct. Of course none but "sound"
operators can do this. It takes but little more
time and application to make a "sound" than
a "paper" operator, and the advantage of the
former is so great in this as well as in other
respects in this service that it should always be
required. Operators readily become able to take
the requisite number of copies in manifold
without the use of intermediate slips, and the
risks of copying are thus avoided. When
more copies are wanted than are made at the
first writing they should be traced from one of
the original copies. In the case of a general
order, as in annulling a train, operators would
usually make but one copy, and others required
for delivery should be traced from this. Careful
supervision should be had as to the actual
practice of operators in the proper use of the
manifold, and as to frequently changing the
carbon paper to secure distinctness.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE RECORD.</p>


<p>A careful record ought to be kept of each
step in the issuing of an order, as well as of its
exact terms. This record should be made on
the original copies held by the Dispatcher, and
by the operator who receives and delivers the
order. The Dispatcher's copy should show who
issued it, and both should indicate what operators
were engaged in its transmission, and
the time at which each step was taken, as well
as the proper address, etc.</p>

<p>The Dispatcher's train sheet should constantly
show the movements of the several
trains, which should be promptly reported by
the operators and recorded by them in the prescribed
forms. A practical difficulty occurs in
making the Dispatcher's record of all the steps
in the issuing of an order, which it may be
well to refer to here. When the Dispatcher is
assisted by an operator, the most of the steps
will be taken and recorded by the latter. They
should be at once recorded on the original
copy of the order, so as to leave nothing to be
remembered or copied. Now, if the Dispatcher
must write the order out in the book before
transmission, the operator may have occasion
to use the book at the same time for recording
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
steps then in progress with reference to other
orders; and if he does not, the passing of the
books back and forth between them is inconvenient.
It has, partly on this account, doubtless,
become the custom with many for the Dispatcher
himself to telegraph the orders without
first writing them down, his operator taking
them down as repeated back and writing them
in the book of record. The operator thus has the
book all the time in his hands. The objections
to the Dispatcher transmitting orders himself
are elsewhere considered, and it is designed
here to point out a method by which the other
plan can be pursued and the inconvenience referred
to avoided. The Dispatcher is provided
with a manifold-book and some loose sheets
properly headed. With these, by the manifold
process, he prepares two copies of the order,
one in his book and the other on a loose sheet
which he hands to the operator for use in transmitting.
On this all the subsequent record is
made by the operator, and at the close of each
day all the orders for that day are fastened
together and filed away. The numbers and
manifold writing sufficiently identify the two
copies if subsequent comparison is necessary,
each being in fact an original. This method
has the further advantage that the Dispatcher
has by him all the time copies of orders he has
issued, for reference if needed.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE TRAIN-ORDER SIGNAL.</p>


<p>A method much used for signaling a train
to stop for orders is to display a flag or light
of suitable color, after receiving the direction
to "hold the train." This is often done by
holding the signal in the hand or placing it on
the platform or ground or in some fixed place.
If placed on the platform, without attendance,
it is liable to be obscured or removed by persons
about the place. If held, in the hand of
the agent or operator it is a poor arrangement
for performing so important an office. The
operator is usually required to report that the
signal is displayed. He evidently cannot do
this without leaving the signal unattended,
and in fact when he is alone he must so leave it,
as, after it is displayed, he must return to the
office to receive the order, and he must also
often be engaged in his office while expecting
a train. It will frequently occur that trains
will pass his station after he has received an order
for some subsequent train; in which case
he must temporarily remove the signal, or stop
a train which might otherwise not be required
to stop. When this plan is used all trains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
that arrive before that for which the order is
held are actually stopped. A serious accident
occurred some years since from the hand-lamp
going out as it was swung as a signal to stop a
train for which orders had been received. The
signal failed, and the train went on and collided
with the opposing train. Lanterns and
flags are the only available movable signals to
be put in the hands of train and track men,
but they should not be relied upon where anything
better can be used. The evils attending
this use of hand signals are so manifest that
the practice is fast disappearing, and the reference
to it here may before long be only a reminder
of what has been done.</p>

<p>A signal for this purpose should be distinctive
and of the most substantial character. A
fixed signal manipulated from within the office
is greatly to be preferred. Several such have
been devised. The signal should be such as
to be distinctly seen at proper distances; it
should be as little as possible liable to confusion
with other objects, and it should be an
adornment rather than a disfigurement to the
landscape in which it forms a prominent feature.
The most satisfactory signal within the
author's knowledge is the simple semaphore
arm, extending horizontally from a post and
showing a red light to signify "stop," and
inclined and showing a white light to signify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
the opposite, and operated by a handle within
the telegraph office.</p>

<p>Much discussion has been had in the past
as to whether a danger signal, which this preeminently
is, should stand normally at safety
or danger. The earlier practice favored the
former, as indicated, above, the absence of a
signal, in the plan described, being the rule. In
more recent years the weight of opinion has
been that in all systems of danger signals the
normal position, and that to which such signals
should automatically move, is that indicating
danger. So arranged, the indicator will always
be in a position to stop trains unless it is
moved to another position to show that there
are no orders for them. It becomes a standing
order to "hold," and, when an order
is forwarded for a train, the fact of its receipt
requires that the signal be simply left in its
normal position and the train thus stopped. It
will be then the rule and the habit of trainmen
to observe all these signals and to stop when
they are not placed, on their approach, in the
position permitting them to proceed.</p>

<p>The rules of many railroads still indicate a
usage contrary to this. The lamp, flag,
or other stop signal is displayed only when
a train is to be stopped for orders. It
appears that under some circumstances,
especially where the duties of the agent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
and operator are performed by the same
person, the telegraphic duties being comparatively
small, it is thought better to retain this
method, and the rules of the Time Convention
were so framed as to provide for either, leaving
the choice to those concerned. Under the
"normal at danger" plan, when an order is
received in advance of the arrival of the train
for which it is designed, and has been properly
verified and prepared for delivery, it remains
in the hands of the operator until the train arrives,
the signal showing "stop." If, in the
mean time, other trains pass for which there
are no orders, the signal must be placed, as
they approach, so as to indicate that they may
pass. But there is then the danger that the
operator may inadvertently allow the train to
pass for which he has an order. This has actually
occurred, and should be provided against.
This should be done by requiring that, as soon
as an order for a train not arrived is ready for
the signatures of the trainmen, or for delivery
when signatures are not taken, the copies designed
for them shall be removed from the
book, folded, and marked with the train number,
and put in a designated place and in such
position that the signal handle cannot be
moved without the eye and hand being directed
to the orders. This is readily effected by a
rack to hold the orders placed on a small door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
closing by a spring and catch over the handle
by which the operator moves the signal. The
handle cannot be moved without unfastening
the door and so opening it as to bring the orders,
which are on it, under the eye and hand
of the operator. This precaution may appear
trivial, but while it is of great importance to
adopt such routine that its mechanical performance
will lead to a correct result, it is
equally important to interpose such obstacles
as are necessary to prevent a mechanical inadvertence
that may lead to disaster. The same
kind of risk exists in the use of block signals,
and several plans have been used to obviate it
by suitable mechanical means. In the other
use of the train-order signal there is, to a certain
extent, the same liability to this unconscious
movement when it has been placed at
danger, and a like precaution is needed to
guard against it. It often happens that there
are orders on hand for several trains. A definite
place for them prevents their getting
mixed with each other or with other papers;
and removing them from the book avoids the
necessity of leafing them over to find the particular
order which men may be waiting to sign,
and possible mistake in getting the wrong
order.</p>

<p>The only reason of apparent moment that
could be assigned for leaving the orders in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
book is that the trainmen may sign all the
copies. There does not appear to be any good
reason for requiring their signatures on their
own copies, and the manifold writing by them
would be unsatisfactory. Again, it will often
happen that more than one train is to receive
a copy of the order, in which case the same
signatures are not wanted on all the copies.
The point here urged as of paramount importance
<i>is that the order itself shall be interposed
between the operator and the instrument
by which he might give a signal permitting
a train to pass improperly</i>. In this view the
discussion of the point is pertinent to the subject
of "Signal." It may be added that the
final indorsement of "complete" after signature
on each copy takes but a moment, and
perhaps no longer than a careful writing of it
over several copies in the manifold-book; and
as the men should read and compare their
copies before the final steps, it is difficult to see
how they could do this properly if the orders
remain in the book.</p>

<p>The train-order signal should be used for no
other than its legitimate purpose. It will not
be inconsistent with this to use it for holding
a train the required time after the passage of
another train in the same direction.</p>

<p>Upon some roads, trains passing while the
stop signal is shown receive a "clearance"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
card stating that orders in hand are not for
them. This is included as a part of the plan
presented in the Time Convention rules for the
use of the signal with its normal position at
safety. It would seem to be necessary with
this method; and in any case where it can be
used it is a valuable precaution, the only objection
being that it requires the stopping of
fast or heavy trains which it might be quite
objectionable to stop. This would seem, however,
to be proper for any train stopped by
the signal for time.</p>

<p>Where the plan is adopted of keeping the
train-order signal normally at safety it should
still, as in the other system, be so arranged
that it will move automatically to danger if
any of the mechanical parts fail. If this is
not done and dependence is placed on fastening
it at danger, the fastenings or some of the connections
may fail and the signal move to safety
without the fact being observed. One important
advantage of the other plan of
using the signal is that it is never at safety
excepting when held in that position by the
operator. Where the usual position is safety
it cannot be arranged for the operator to actually
hold the signal while it occupies the danger
position.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE TRANSMISSION.</p>


<p>The transmission of orders will be taken to
include all the steps after preparation by the
Dispatcher until final delivery.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<p>1. Telegraphing the order to the stations to
which it is to be sent.</p>

<p>2. Writing down as received.</p>

<p>3. Repeating it back to the Dispatcher.</p>

<p>4. The response of the Dispatcher indicating
that it is correctly repeated.</p>

<p>5. The acknowledgment of this response.</p>

<p>6. Comparing copies of the order with the
persons to whom it is addressed, and taking
their signatures.</p>

<p>7. Telegraphing the signatures to the Dispatcher's
office.</p>

<p>8. The Dispatcher's reply, acknowledging
the receipt of the signatures, and indicating
that the order may now be delivered.</p>

<p>9. The indorsement of this reply on the
order.</p>

<p>10. The delivery to the trainmen.</p>

<p>Some Dispatchers prefer to personally telegraph
their orders, having an assistant operator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
to copy them as transmitted or as repeated,
and to perform the subsequent work of verification,
record, etc. Those who are accustomed
to transmit their own orders strongly contend
for that practice. Those who pursue a different
course are equally strong for theirs. In
arranging for those, at least, who have not become
wedded to any particular method, general
consideration should govern. If contests
or inquiries arise on the wire when the Dispatcher
is sending, time is occupied which he
may very much need, and where the amount
of work is large it will leave the Dispatcher
more at liberty to attend to his special duty if
he simply prepares his orders and hands them
to an operator for the subsequent steps, and
this is by some carefully insisted upon.</p>

<p>The Dispatcher's duty is not simply to direct
each movement as the exigency arrives. He
should be constantly on the alert to provide as
far as possible in advance for the arrangements
necessary for keeping his trains moving, and his
mind should be free from anything that may
interfere with this. Attention by him to the
merely mechanical duties detracts from his
usefulness and the benefits which the road
should derive from the talents which are supposed
to fit him for his position. Some points
connected with this subject are referred
to in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>. Whether sent personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
by the Dispatcher or by an operator from a
written sheet, the order should, whenever practicable,
<i>be transmitted simultaneously to all the
offices to which it is to be sent</i>. Ordinarily this
will be to but two offices. An order annulling
a train may have to be sent to all the offices on
the division. The simultaneous transmission
is a most valuable safeguard and a saving in
telegraphing only practicable with the duplicate
order. It has been urged as an objection
to the duplicate order that where agents act as
operators their duties as agents may sometimes
interfere with their attendance as operators
when wanted for simultaneous transmission.
This furnishes no ground for objecting to this
form of order, as simultaneous transmission is
not essential, and it is only necessary in such
case that the precaution be observed of sending
first to the train of superior right.</p>

<p>On calling an office a special signal should
be used to indicate that a train-order is to be
sent. The numerals 31 or 19 are now generally
used for this purpose, the former for
orders to be signed by the trainmen before delivery
and the latter for orders to be delivered
without such signature. After this signal the
word "copy" should follow, with a number
indicating how many copies are to be made.
This maybe omitted when three is the number
required, that being the most usual. If the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
system in use does not provide that the train-order
signal shall stand normally in the "danger"
position, the operator who is to receive
the order must, at this point, place it in that
position and report that he has done so.
He then prepares his manifold-book for the
requisite number of copies and takes the order
down as sent, with the proper address for his
station, immediately repeating it back word
for word, <i>reading from the order as actually
written on the paper to be delivered</i>, and not
from a slip to be afterward copied. A "paper"
operator should write the order in manifold
before repeating. Some defer the repeating
until the signatures of the trainmen are to
be reported. But it is on many accounts preferable
to repeat and verify the order at once
and before signatures are taken, even if the
trainmen are present. It assures its accuracy
before they have read and signed it. The repeating
operators can listen to each other better
than if they repeat at different times, and
the sender of the order can better attend to its
verification while the original lies before him.
There will also be less detention to trains if the
repeating is done before their arrival. The
importance of this will further appear from
the consideration elsewhere of the effect of an
order where the telegraph fails after but one
train has received and proceeded on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span></p>

<p>The relative succession in which the offices
are to repeat should be fixed by rule or usage,
to avoid doubt or conflict. It is better that
the repeating be done in the same succession
as that in which the several offices are addressed.
This assures the repeating first by
the office receiving for the superior train.
As a valuable precaution against error, <i>each
should be required to listen while the others
repeat</i>. An operator has been known to hear
the name of a meeting-place correctly, write it
down incorrectly in the order and repeat it back
correctly. If he had looked at his copy as the
other repeated, he would probably have noticed
his error.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be observed that
too much importance cannot be attached to
the cultivation of a careful habit in telegraphing
orders. A certain degree of rapidity in
handling the key is not inconsistent with distinctness,
but the latter should never be sacrificed
to haste and a hurried and careless style
of telegraphing should never be permitted.</p>

<p>The operator in the Dispatcher's office should
carefully observe each word as repeated by
each, to make sure that all is repeated correctly.
Some observe the commendable practice
of underscoring each word as repeated,
thus making sure that their attention is not
withdrawn. If the Dispatcher transmits his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
orders himself and his copy for record is made
as the order is repeated, as is the practice of
some, his copy can hardly be said to be an
original. It may vary from what was sent or
designed to be sent, and his operator taking it
down has not the opportunity of checking as
above, and may himself make a mistake in receiving
it. All offices required at the time to
repeat an order should do so before the Dispatcher
replies. The signal for this reply now
generally used, and adopted for the "Standard"
Code, is "O K." This is given simultaneously
to all, naming each, and each should
acknowledge it. It is important that the Dispatcher
should know that each has received
the "O K." It is not necessary that the Dispatcher
personally authorize this reply. It
may be properly done by his operator who has
watched the repeating. Where the order is
not repeated back until the signatures are obtained
and sent with it, the response, "O K"
and sometimes "complete" is used to cover
the whole, but where the practice herein
recommended is pursued, the use of two signals
is necessary, "O K" being the first.
The time at which the order is sent and "O
K" given should be noted on all the copies,
with the initials or signals of the operators
sending and receiving, and the name or initials
of the superintendent. The order is then ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
for signature and delivery, and, if the train
for which it is designed has not arrived, the
train copies should be removed from the book,
folded and marked on the outside with the
train number, and placed in the rack provided,
as indicated under The Train-Order Signal.</p>

<p>Practice has varied very much in the method
of delivering orders. Some have simply had
them authenticated by repeating back as above,
with perhaps the proviso that the trainmen compare
their copies with that of the operator, and
in some cases sign for them. The transmitting
of signatures has not in all cases been required.
Many rules, especially those of early date,
appear to be based on the idea that the whole
process of sending, verifying, and acknowledging
an order is to be continuous and while the
train is at the station. Much that appears in
some rules gives the impression that either
this idea prevailed or that the phraseology
used in connection with it was retained while
the practice had changed. On a busy road it
would certainly be impracticable to carry out
this idea, and it is not now usually attempted.</p>

<p>In early days of train telegraphy, when orders
were not prepared with the precision of the
present day, it was the custom to add to the
order the phrase "how do you understand?"
This came to be represented by a signal, the
most generally used perhaps being the numeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
"31." The reply to this, preceded by "we understand
we are to," represented by "13" or
other numeral, was required to be written out
by the trainmen as their "understanding."
This was probably in most cases a verbatim
copy of the order. Whether this was actually
done by the conductor and engineman is doubtful.
Some allowed the operator to do it. With
the definite forms of orders now used and well
understood, there is certainly no necessity for
men to write out their "understanding." The
manifold copies, authenticated by repeating
back and compared by reading aloud, which
also serves to impress the order on the men,
must certainly be better than anything written
by or for them. There would seem to be no
reason for perpetuating a fiction by referring
to the repeating of the order as the "understanding"
or by the use of "31" and "13"
in their original sense, when the question and
answer which they represent are no longer designed
to be used, and this practice and the
expressions which arose under it have almost
entirely given place to the improved methods.</p>

<p>Following, then, the practice here recommended
and now generally used, the message
has been placed in the hands of the operator and
its verbal accuracy assured, and the train-order
signal being in position to stop the train, the
conductor and engineman understand that on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
arrival they are to go to the office "for orders."
One of them (or the operator) should read the
order aloud while each looks at his copy, the
object being <i>to guard against a hurried reading
of the order, to acquaint them fully with
its exact terms, and to impress its purport
upon them</i>. It is to be hoped that no man
would willfully disregard a train order, but
there are many who would proceed upon a
hasty examination or none at all, if permitted
to do so, and perhaps on a wrong impression
as to what it directs to be done.</p>

<p>The order having been thus read and compared,
the signatures should be taken on the
operator's copy. From the many rules forbidding
operators to sign for trainmen, and conductors
for enginemen, it would seem probable that
this is sometimes done. This is a practice
which no considerations of convenience can justify.
Personal signatures should be insisted
upon. Without this there is danger that men
will hastily "grab" an order and fail to get
its meaning. Time is well spent in securing
their particular attention to it, and their signatures
attest that this has been done.</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion as to
whether it is important to take the signature
of the engineman. Much time is often lost by
taking him from his engine, particularly on
very long trains, and some think that the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
is as well served by having his copy delivered
to him by the conductor. In the latter
plan there is some danger that the attention of
the engineman may not be particularly called
to the purport of the order, and for this reason
the author believes that the practice is best
where both signatures are required. The Time
Convention code leaves the choice optional.</p>

<p>The signatures having been obtained, the
Dispatcher is to be advised, by their transmission
to him, in connection with the number of
the order signed for and the train number or
designation. The reply that all is satisfactory,
authorized by the Dispatcher personally, is
then to be given in some prescribed form.
The word "complete" has been adopted in the
"Standard Code," superseding "correct,"
which was formerly used.</p>

<p>The selected word should be written on each
copy, with the exact time at which it was
given. The order may then be delivered, and
the train order signal so placed as to allow the
train to proceed. If the Dispatcher's office is
also used as an office for delivering orders, the
same formalities in delivery should be observed
as at way offices.</p>

<p>It will sometimes occur that an order must
be sent to a disabled or other train away from
a telegraph station. It must, in that case, pass
through additional hands, and great care is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
necessary to guard against error. The conductor
or messenger who carries the order
should be made accountable for its delivery in
proper form, by himself signing for it and
getting "complete." The order being addressed
to the conductor and engineman of
the train "in care of" the messenger selected,
the latter should be furnished with an additional
copy, on which he is to take the signatures
of the conductor and engineman, as if
they were at a telegraph office. This copy
should be delivered as soon as practicable to
an operator, who should forward the signatures,
completing the process.</p>

<p>Although when these paragraphs were
first written the method of transmission
described did not correspond entirely with
any practice that might be termed general,
it agreed in essential points with the practice
upon several roads where most careful
consideration has been given to the various
risks in train dispatching and to methods for
avoiding them. The process detailed indicates
the points to be guarded, and furnishes what has
proved a practicable and satisfactory method,
and corresponds with the regulations now
being rapidly adopted on our principal roads.</p>

<p>The rules should determine the course to be
pursued if the telegraph fails during the process
of transmitting an order. If this occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
before its correct reception is assured by repeating
back and giving and acknowledging
"O K" for any office concerned, the process
is not sufficiently complete for the men
of a train at such office to be allowed to
sign for and act upon it. If, therefore, communication
is not quickly restored it is perfectly
safe and proper to provide that an operator
shall permit a train, in such case, to proceed
on its schedule rights without orders. If, on the
other hand, "O K" has been given and acknowledged,
the correct reception of the order
is assured, and a period is reached when the men
of a train may, and often must, be permitted,
on arrival, to sign for and act on the order
before the arrival of the other at the point
where the order is awaiting it. If the men of
one train have thus proceeded, and the other
on arrival cannot be communicated with,
it would be obviously unsafe for it to proceed
upon the order awaiting it for which
signatures cannot be transmitted, because,
although the opposing train may be on the
way to execute the order, this is not known
to the train that is cut off from communication.
It would therefore be improper for it
to proceed either in accordance with the order
or on schedule rights. It would appear, therefore,
that an order wholly or partly sent by
the process detailed, and for which "O K" cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
be given and acknowledged by reason of the
telegraph failing, should not operate to hold
the train addressed, but that an order for which
"O K" has been given and acknowledged
should have this effect. The rule should therefore
be <i>that, after "O K" is given to an
order and acknowledged, the train to which
the order is addressed shall not be permitted
to pass until the signatures are transmitted
and "complete" obtained</i>, or until the train
can be communicated with by the Dispatcher.
This is based, of course, upon the presumption
that the plan is followed of assuring the accurate
transmission for both trains, and that each
operator has acknowledged the "O K" before
"complete" is given to either. The delays
arising from the operation of this rule cannot be
frequent, and it is better to submit to these than
to run the risk involved in a different course.</p>

<p>In the use of the "19" order, to which the
signatures of the trainmen are not taken, the
order becomes of effect only when "complete"
has been given and acknowledged; and until
this is accomplished it should be treated as of
the same effect as a "31" order for which
"O K" has not been given and acknowledged.</p>

<p>If the practice is followed of delaying the
repeating of the order until the signatures are
obtained and sent, then the presence of the order
in the operator's hands should serve to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
hold either train if the telegraph fails, as
neither can know but that the other train has
received the order and proceeded on it. It
must be seen, however, that there is some risk
in depending on a train being held by the
mere presence of an order, the correct reception
of which has not been fully acknowledged,
as the receiving operator may even have made
an error in receiving the number of the train
for which the order is designed; and this offers
an additional reason for repeating back at once
on the receipt of the order. These considerations
as to the holding effect of an order when
the telegraph fails, do not, of course, apply to
a general order, as one annulling a train, until
such order is specially addressed to a train.
It should be understood that operators hold
trains a reasonable time for the resumption of
communication broken during the transmission
of orders.</p>

<p>It is important that the holding effect of
an order not signed for should be clearly understood,
so that the Dispatcher may run
trains with confidence against a train so held.</p>

<p>A careful Dispatcher will observe that the
inconveniences arising from a train being held
by the incomplete transmission of an order
will be greater as the distance is greater between
the point to which the order is sent for
delivery and the point where it is to take effect.</p>

<p class="caption3">RULES.</p>


<p>Many books of Rules have borne evidence
that the ability to construct rules is not always
commensurate with the many other gifts of
successful railroad officers. To know what is
to be done and how is one thing, but it is
quite another to express the intention clearly
and concisely. A scholar might present
the subject in precise and grammatical
form, and yet fail to so render it as to make it
plain to practical men of limited education;
and yet, while the language must be clear to
the untrained mind, there should be no expressions
that are not within the bounds of
rhetorical propriety. The evident difficulties
surrounding the subject render more conspicuous
the admirable results of the work of the
able committee of the General Time Convention
in the production of the "Standard"
code of train and telegraph rules contributed
by that body to the railroad service. To have
produced a set of rules that should be accepted
for general adoption, in which so few deficiencies
have been pointed out, is a work worthy
of the highest commendation. Under the operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
of these rules will disappear the uncertainty
often appearing in anxious inquiries
by "Conductor" or "Train-Master," in the
railroad papers, as to how this rule or that order
is to be understood under given circumstances.
There will be fewer occasions for
trainmen to reconcile conflicting regulations
and fewer cases of "doubt," in which to
"take the safe course and run no risks."</p>

<p>No one, however, feels that entire perfection
has been reached, in practice or statement, or
that even in the near future, additions or
changes may not be found desirable; and, as
methods of operation improve, scope will
doubtless still be found for fresh talent in the
production of regulations for new combinations
of circumstances as well as improvement
in those prepared by earlier hands.</p>

<p>The Telegraph Rules of the Time Convention,
adopted October 12th, 1887, are here
given, with some discussion relating to them.
In considering these rules mention will necessarily
be made of points referred to on previous
pages and which are here embodied in
form for practical use. This necessarily involves
some apparent repetition. The rules
are here designated by the numbers given to
them by the Time Convention Committee; and
it may be here stated that, in conformity with
the method followed in the Time Convention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
train rules, the term "time-table" is herein
applied to the issue governing the movements
of all regular trains, while "schedule" is used
to designate that part of the time-table which
applies to any one train.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 500.</span>—Special orders directing movements varying
from or additional to the time-table will be issued by the authority
and over the signature of the Superintendent. They
are not to be used for movements that can be provided for
by rule or time-table. They must not contain information or
instructions not essentially a part of them.</p>

<p>They must be brief and clear, and the prescribed forms
must be used when applicable; and there must be no erasures,
alterations, or interlineations.</p>
</div>

<p>This rule indicates the proper function of a
Telegraphic Train Order, the authority under
which it is to be given, and the essential features
of its construction, with the requirement
that the prescribed forms are to be used when
applicable. While in the fixed forms provision
is made for the majority at least of the cases
likely to occur, occasions will doubtless arise
when other forms or modifications of these will
be required. It is therefore important that the
principles on which these forms are to be constructed
be distinctly stated. The provisions
as to how orders shall be issued and as to the
use of the forms, when applicable, and the absence
of alterations, are all necessary as tending
to secure uniformity and accuracy. The
following note, attached by the Time Convention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
Committee, emphasizes a point hereinbefore
dwelt upon as of great importance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—On Roads whose organization provides that any other
officer than the Superintendent shall direct train movements,
the official title of such officer may be substituted in the above
rule. The Committee considers it essential, however, that but
one person's signature should be used in directing train movements
on any dispatching division.]</p>
</div>


<div class="pmt2 blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 501.</span>—Each order must be given in the same words to
all persons or trains directly affected by it, so that each shall
have a duplicate of what is given to the others. Preferably
an order should include but one specified movement.</p></div>

<p>Here is determined the feature essential to
the "duplicate" system, viz., that the order
shall be "in the same words" to all concerned;
and the preference is here given to the point
urged by the author, of covering but one movement
by an order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 502.</span>—Orders will be numbered consecutively for each
day as issued, beginning with No. 1 at midnight.</p></div>

<p>The use of numbers for orders serves to
identify each order and to indicate the priority
of issue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 503.</span>—Orders must be addressed to those who are to
execute them, naming the place at which each is to receive
his copy. Those for a train must be addressed to the conductor
and engineman, and also to a person acting as pilot.
A copy for each person addressed must be supplied by the
operator.</p></div>

<p>The requirement here that orders shall be
addressed to those who are to execute them
might seem superfluous but for some former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
looseness in this respect and the necessity for
exactness in prescribing each step in the process
of issue. The address, including the place
of delivery, is necessary as indicating, in simultaneous
transmission, which operators are
to receive for those respectively to whom the
orders are sent. The introduction of the Pilot
here is valuable. As the one under whose special
direction the train is for the time being,
he should be directly informed of orders controlling
its movements. The conductor and
engineman who are in charge of the train
subject to his control, are also necessarily advised.
The relations of the Pilot to the train
are much the same as those of the pilot to a
vessel of which he has control for the time
being. He is placed there because of his having
special knowledge, not possessed by the
conductor and engineman, of circumstances
which necessarily affect the movement, and has
entire control of the train in this respect. He
may or may not be an engineman. He may or
may not run the engine. He, however, is to
say when it may or may not run, and is the
person by whose authority the movements are
to be regulated with reference to the signals
and the physical features of the road and with
respect to other trains as well as the established
rules. He does not assume the duties of the
conductor as to those things which are purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
local to the train, and the brakemen and fireman
are properly held to be under his orders
through the conductor and engineman. The
trainmen are not, by the presence of the Pilot,
relieved from the usual obligation to protect the
train and perform other duties connected with
it or required by the rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 504.</span>—Each order must be written in full in a book
provided for the purpose at the Superintendent's office; and
with it must be recorded the names of trainmen and
others who have signed for the order, the time and signals,
showing when and from what offices the order and responses
were transmitted, and the Train Dispatcher's initials. These
records must be made at once on the original copy, and not
afterward from memory or memoranda.</p></div>

<p>The requirement here as to the record of
each order in a book is usually now fulfilled
by the preservation of a manifold copy in the
book in which the blanks are bound. This, in
fact, is the method contemplated, although the
rule is so drawn as to admit of other methods.
The record of the various points specified is
requisite for a complete history of each transaction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 505.</span>—The terms "superior right" and "inferior right"
in these rules refer to the rights of trains under the Time-table
and Train Rules, and not to rights under Special
Orders.</p></div>

<p>This rule is rather an authoritative statement
of a logical conclusion from the facts,
but very properly gives this prominence to a
point that must be constantly borne in mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
When the rights of trains are reversed by an
order, as is usually the case, the inferior becomes
for a time the superior, and this definition
emphasizes this. In this connection it
may be again noted that a very important and
necessary part of the training of those engaged
in operating the railroad telegraph is the acquisition
of an intimate knowledge of the rules
governing the rights and movements of trains
when acting independently of telegraphic control.
The legitimate use of the telegraph is to
facilitate movement when, under the unaided
operation of the rules, there might be delay,
and to give preference, for special reasons, to
trains which, under the rules are inferior. An
exact knowledge of the effect of the rules, and
what may be done by trains under their provisions,
is therefore important, so that there
shall be no unnecessary use of special orders,
and that those used shall be the most appropriate
to the circumstances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 506.</span>—When an order is to be transmitted, the signal
"31" (as provided in Rule 509) or the signal "19" (as provided
in Rule 511), meaning "Train Order," will be given to each
office addressed, followed by the word "copy," and a figure
indicating the number of copies to be made, if more or less
than three—thus, "31 copy 5," or "19 copy 5."</p></div>

<p>This rule begins upon the details of transmission
and is the first in which mention is
made of the special signals "31" and "19,"
signifying "train order," the use of which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
more fully indicated later on. We have here
the first step in the methodical plan of transmission
prescribed in these rules, preparing
the operator for the reception of the order and
informing him of the number of copies for
which he must prepare his manifold sheets.
As three is the number most usually required,
the omission of this number economizes telegraphing.
In the same case the word "copy"
might as well be omitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 507.</span>—An order to be sent to two or more offices must
be transmitted simultaneously to as many as practicable.
The several addresses must be in the order of superiority of
rights of trains, and each office will take only its proper
address. When not sent simultaneously to all, the order
must be sent first for the train having the superior right of
track.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—On roads which desire the operator at a
meeting-point to have copies of the order, the several addresses
will be, first, the operator at whose station the trains are
to meet and next in the order of superiority of the rights of
trains.]</p></div>

<p>This rule brings us to the transmission of
the order and requires that it be simultaneous
as far as possible. This is a safeguard possible
only with the duplicate system. Here also
the priority of transmission to the superior
train is insisted upon. In addition to other
advantages, the systematic naming of the superior
train first calls the attention of operators
to the relative superiority of trains. The
principle involved here is elsewhere recognized.
The note attached by the Time Convention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
Committee has reference to the arrangement
which some prefer of sending a copy of
the order to the operator at the meeting-point
in addition to the copies sent to other points
for delivery to the trains.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 508.</span>—Operators receiving orders must write them out
in manifold during transmission, and make the requisite
number of copies at one writing or trace others from one of
the copies first made.</p></div>

<p>This rule directs the use of the manifold
writing and practically dispenses with any
record book other than that in which the manifold
copies are preserved.</p>

<p>This is one of the most important improvements
over the old methods. In the early days
of telegraphing and with some to a comparatively
recent period, each copy of an order was
written separately, occupying much time and
involving great liability to error in transcribing.
Now the perfection of the manifold admits
of making at one writing all the copies
usually required. If additional copies are
wanted, their exactness is assured by tracing
from one of those made at the first writing. It
must be observed here that the rule does not
permit an operator to take the message down
on a separate sheet and make his manifold
copies afterward.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 509.</span>—When an order has been transmitted, preceded
by the signal "31," operators receiving it must (unless otherwise
directed) repeat it back at once from the manifold copy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
and in the succession in which their several offices have been
addressed. Each operator repeating must observe whether
the others repeat correctly. After the order has been repeated
correctly by the operators required at the time to repeat it,
the response "O K," authorized by the Train Dispatcher,
will be sent simultaneously to as many as practicable,
naming each office. Each operator must write this on
the order with the time, and then reply "i i O K," with his
office signal.</p>

<p>Those to whom the order is addressed, except enginemen,
must then sign their names to the copy of the order to be retained
by the operator, and he will send their signatures to
the Superintendent. The response "complete," with the
Superintendent's initials, will then be given, when authorized
by the Train Dispatcher. Each operator receiving this
response will then write on each copy the word "complete," the
time, and his last name in full; and will then deliver a copy to
each person included in the address, except enginemen,
and each must read his copy aloud to the operator. The copy
for each engineman must be delivered to him personally by
----, and the engineman must read it aloud and understand
it before acting upon it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The blank in the above rule may be filled for each road to
suit its own requirements. On roads where the signature of the
engineman is desired, the words "except enginemen" and the
last sentence in the second paragraph may be omitted. See
also note under Rule No. 500.]</p>

<p>[Individual operator's signals may be used when desired in addition
to office signals, as here and elsewhere provided for.]</p></div>

<p>In this rule are given in detail the steps to
be taken after the order has been transmitted,
this rule having special reference to the orders
for which signatures of trainmen are to be
taken, known technically as the "31" order.
Much of the efficiency of the telegraph, as well
as the safety of operation, depends upon the
careful drill of operators in this respect and
strict adherence to the requirements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
rule. Repeating back at the time of receiving
may be properly omitted under the direction
of the Dispatcher, in case of a general order,
as one annulling a train. This would be sent
to all stations but not necessarily delivered at
all, and therefore repeating back at once from
all would unnecessarily occupy the wire. Other
cases may arise where the repeating may be
postponed. In repeating, however, the requirement
that it be done from the manifold
copy should be carefully complied with. Reading,
word for word, from the copy actually to
be delivered is one of the most important precautions
against mistake. The succession in
which offices are to repeat is prescribed, so that
all shall understand it, and it is so fixed that
the repeating shall be done in the order of superiority
of trains addressed. As a repeated
order for which the "O K" has been given
and acknowledged serves to hold the train addressed,
this secures the superior train at once.</p>

<p>The requirement that operators observe the
repeating by each other is a further valuable
safeguard.</p>

<p>The next step, that of transmitting the "O
K," is now prescribed in the same methodical
way and its acknowledgment provided for.
Without this acknowledgment the Dispatcher
could not be sure of the train being held,
and it is quite important, although not directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
in the rule, that the acknowledgment of the
"O K" should be made by the different offices
in the succession in which they were addressed.
This brings us to the point where the order is
fully in the hands of the operator and becomes
operative to a certain extent, as is seen in Rule
510. The train for which an order has thus
been sent may not have yet arrived. By the
rule, however, the signal is displayed to stop
the train, and when it arrives the conductor
(and the engineman if required) must go to the
office and sign for the order. The signature
(or signatures) must then be telegraphed to the
Dispatcher's office, and when found correct the
final response, "complete," is given, signifying
that all the steps in telegraphing have been
taken that are necessary before delivery. It
still remains for the receiving operator to record
the "complete" on the order, with the
time and his name, all of which are important
for the completion of a paper which involves
the safety of human life. It is still, however,
possible that those who are to use this important
paper may fail to observe its full signification,
and it is therefore provided, as a final
precaution, that each one who receives it shall
read it aloud to the operator, who has his own
copy before him. This is better than reading
by the operator to the trainmen, as they might
not listen attentively, while they can hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
fail to note the signification of words which
they themselves read aloud.</p>

<p>The notes appended by the Time Convention
Committee point out modifications which may
be made with respect to certain points in which
difference of practice prevails and which do not
affect the essential features of the plan.</p>

<p>The author believes that the weight of sentiment
is decidedly in favor of taking the signature
of the engineman as well as that of the conductor
for the order, unless controlling circumstances
prevent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 510.</span>—For an order preceded by the signal "31,"
"complete" must not be given to the order for delivery to a
train of inferior right until "O K" has been given to and acknowledged
by the operator who receives the order for the
train of superior right. Whenever practicable, the signature
of the conductor of the train of superior right must be taken
to the order and "complete" given before the train of inferior
right is allowed to act on it.</p>

<p><i>After</i> "O K" has been given and acknowledged, and <i>before</i>
"complete" has been given, the order must be treated as a
holding order for the train addressed, but must not be otherwise
acted on until "complete" has been given.</p>

<p>If the line fails <i>before an office has received and acknowledged</i>
"<i>O K</i>" to an order preceded by the signal "31," the order at
that office is of no effect, and must be there treated as if it
had not been sent.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—On roads where the signature of the engineman and pilot
is desired, the words "engineman and pilot" may be added
after the word "conductor" in the first paragraph of Rule 510.]</p></div>

<p>Rule 510 presents a requirement of very
great importance in prescribing that "complete"
shall not be given for the inferior train
until "O K" has been given and acknowledged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
for the superior. The reason for this is
apparent from the following considerations:
When "complete" has been given, the train
receiving an order on which it is indorsed may
at once proceed to the execution of the order.
If it has rights given to it against a superior
train, it is of the highest importance that the
latter shall be informed of this before it can
proceed to a point where the order may bring
the inferior into conflict with the rights of
the other. After "O K" has been given and
acknowledged for the order at the point where
the superior train is to receive it, the order
"holds" the superior train, as provided in the
second paragraph, and it is only then safe to
permit the inferior train to proceed, by giving
for it the final word "complete." It would
be still better if in all cases the signatures of
the men of the superior train could be taken
before the other is permitted to act on the order.
The rule requires this "whenever practicable."
It is, however, often not practicable
on account of the varying and often considerable
distances between telegraph stations, the
varying speed of trains, and unforeseen and
unpreventable delays. It is doubtful whether
any reasonable expenditure in increasing the
number of offices would admit of absolute
compliance with such a requirement, but it is
quite true that any expenditure at all approaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
what this would require would
be much beyond the ability of the majority
of railroads. It is also true that, at least
without enormous additions to the facilities,
a strict requirement of this kind would interfere
with the movement of trains to an extent
that the patrons of the roads would never
agree to. If the plan provided in the rules
really involves any risk in this respect, it is
one which cannot be avoided in the present
state of financial ability and of the means of
moving trains.</p>

<p>The closing paragraph of the rule provides
for the contingency of the failure of telegraphic
communication at a critical moment in the
transmission.</p>

<p>An order may have been fully received by
an operator, but, if the telegraph fails before
he can repeat it back and be informed by the
Dispatcher that it is "O K," it would not be
safe to use it. Neither is it proper that it
should have any effect whatever until the Dispatcher
is assured, by the acknowledgment of
the "O K," that it has been received. When
an order has been transmitted and is altogether
in the hands of the operator, there is the
chance that he may have written down some
important word incorrectly. Hence the requirement
that he repeat it back. This, if carefully
performed, assures the Dispatcher of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
verbal accuracy of the message as the operator
has it, and the Dispatcher admits this by the
response "O K." He must now act, with reference
to this train, as if it were held at the
point at which it is addressed. But he cannot
assume this until he is assured that "O K"
has been received. This is by the required acknowledgment.</p>

<p>If communication absolutely fails before the
completion of this process, all that he has done
goes for nothing unless communication is
quickly restored. It is of the utmost importance
that the Dispatcher know what will
or will not be done by a train to which an
order has been addressed, as this knowledge
guides him in giving other orders. It would
not be proper, even, to assume that a
train would be held by the presence of an
order addressed to it unless the accuracy of
the order is assured, for an error may have
occurred in receiving the address and the
wrong train number may have been noted.
Nor will it do for a train to proceed regardless
of an order addressed to it when the whole
process of transmission cannot be completed,
unless the rule authorizing it is made to
specify the precise point in the process of
transmission when this may be permitted.
It is also of equal importance that, in the
absence of telegraphic communication with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
a train, the Dispatcher can depend upon the
fact that it will act in accordance with
the rules, notwithstanding a partial transmission
of an order intended to control its
movements. Briefly, he must know whether
the train retains the right to proceed or not,
and under what conditions, or he cannot intelligently
direct other trains with reference
to it. The question how long a train should
wait for communication to be restored must
depend upon so many circumstances that no
rule can be given. The "break" may be but
momentary or it may last for hours. The
train may have just time to get to a regular
meeting-place, at which, if reached in time, it
may have to lie for belated trains. Rules must
fail here to indicate what is best to be done,
and often the best judgment is no guide.
Whatever is determined on may involve delay.
It should never involve danger.</p>

<p>There is a plan in use on several prominent
roads by which it is claimed that the objectionable
feature in Rule 510, represented by
the phrase "whenever practicable," may be
eliminated. Under this plan there is added
an "advance" order, issued to the superior
train, directing it to stop "for orders" at a
point where it is intended to deposit for it the
duplicate of a meeting or other order on which
an inferior train is to be permitted to proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
from some other point before the order
is received by the superior train. By this
plan the superior train is "held" before the
inferior is allowed to act on the order, and thus
far the risk is avoided of the superior being improperly
allowed to pass the point where the
duplicate order is to be placed for it. It is
claimed that a considerable experience has
demonstrated that this plan is feasible and
secures the object in view, and that with it
the rule of always first securing the superior
train may be made absolute. Experience is
one of the best of teachers, and few theories
can be taken as proved without it, but even
imperfect methods may produce good results
under careful management, so that experience
alone is not sufficient for determining the
merits of a system.</p>

<p>The purpose of the plan in question, to
"hold" the superior train before giving orders
against it is good, and what all wish to
accomplish. This idea gave rise to the "hold"
order of the older methods of train dispatching
and it has been suggested that under the
advance-order plan there is danger of a relapse
from strict adherence to the duplicate method.
Careful supervision may prevent this.</p>

<p>If the advance order is invariably given, operators
may get to depending on it rather than
on their own care for stopping trains at points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
where duplicates are deposited. This is a
point to be carefully considered and on which
the railroad fraternity will be by no means
agreed. Two things are depended on. If one
fails we have the other. Many hold that this
is better than to rely on one alone. Many,
again, maintain that, where the responsibility
is thus divided, each party may depend on
the other and both fail, while, if there is but
one, his sense of responsibility is quickened
and the result is better. In view of the difference
of opinion on this point it may be said
that if this be the only point in the consideration
of the advance order it may be given a
trial.</p>

<p>If it is to be tried, then we must see that
there are no exceptions to its use. The Dispatcher
must always anticipate possible contingencies
long enough ahead to be able to
designate in advance the points where trains
are to stop for orders, and he must do this
before the necessity arises of allowing the inferior
train to proceed on orders which the superior
trains are subsequently to receive. If
he cannot thus anticipate he must still give
the order to stop for orders and send it to the
point to which the meeting-order is sent, both
to be delivered to the superior at the same
time; and in that case he must depend upon
the signal at that point for stopping the train,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
as in the Standard rules, or always keep the
inferior train from acting on the order until
the orders for the other train are delivered.</p>

<p>Again, a train for which it is thought meeting-orders
may have to be given must make a
stop in order to get the advance order, and
again another at the point named in it, perhaps
only that it may receive an order annulling
the first, if meeting-orders are found not to be
needed. Frequently a duplicate order may
be placed for a train and annulled before its
arrival if the occasion for it has passed, but
the advantage of this is lost if the advance
order is used.</p>

<p>There are many roads on which the circumstances
would not admit of thus always seeing
far enough in advance the things to be done,
and very many on which the business would
not admit of the stops necessary, and the occurrence
of a single exception would vitiate
the whole and make it necessary to fall back
on the provision "whenever practicable."</p>

<p>It is not easy to see how the rule could be
invariably applied at junction points at
which trains of superior right are to arrive
from other roads or divisions, and circumstances
are so various that it is difficult
to determine just where such a plan could
or could not be satisfactorily applied. Some
say they have succeeded with it. Others point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
out quite conclusively that the circumstances
with them are such that it would be impracticable.
Where it can be applied and used
without exception and the question of divided
responsibility can be satisfactorily disposed of,
it is, to say the least, an experiment in the
right direction, but it is to be very much feared
that this plan does not yet supply the universal
remedy for the difficulty involved in the phrase
"whenever practicable." The multiplication
of messages on a busy wire will occur to all
as a serious objection, but scarcely as one that
should weigh against positive considerations
of safety.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 511.</span>—When an order has been transmitted, preceded
by the signal "19," operators receiving it must (unless otherwise
directed) repeat it back at once from the manifold copy,
and in the succession in which the several offices have been
addressed. Each operator repeating must observe whether
the others repeat correctly. After the order has been repeated
correctly, the response "complete," with the Superintendent's
initials, will be given, when authorized by the
Train Dispatcher. Each operator receiving this response
must write on each copy the word "complete," the time, and
his last name in full, and reply "i i complete" with his office
signal, and will personally deliver the order to the persons
addressed, without taking their signatures.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—On roads where it is desired, the signatures of the conductors
(or conductors, enginemen, and pilots) may be taken by
the operator on the delivery of the order. See also note under
Rule 500. The Committee has recommended two forms of train
orders—the "31" order and the "19" order; leaving it discretionary
with the roads to adopt one or both of these forms.]</p></div>

<p>This rule provides for the steps in transmission
of the "19" order, for which signatures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
of trainmen are not required, as Rule 509 does
for the "31" order. The steps are the same
excepting as to the "O K" and its acknowledgment
and the signatures. The same general considerations
apply to the steps which are identical.
The absence of the requirement as to
signatures renders the "O K" unnecessary,
the "complete" being the Dispatcher's notice
both that the order has been correctly repeated
and that it may be delivered after "complete"
has been acknowledged, which should be in
the succession in which offices are addressed.
The responsibility of delivery to the right
parties is placed on the operator.</p>

<p>The use of this method, rather than that under
which trainmen sign for the order, has
been the subject of much serious thought and
discussion. In either case the "danger" signal
and the carefulness of the operator are the
means depended on for stopping a train for
which an order has been transmitted. The
difference is in the mode of delivery. If signatures
are taken the men must take the time
to go to the office. If they are not taken the
men may go to the office or the operator may
go out to deliver. The train may perhaps not
stop entirely. In any event the delivery is
likely to be hasty and without careful inspection
of the order by those who receive it. A
conservative view would seem to indicate that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
there were some risk in this, and yet many experienced
officers do not look upon it in that
light, and on roads having heavy traffic and
many fast trains this method is used with satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>The real solution of the question may be in
careful supervision, good discipline, correct
habits, and strict attention to business. In
these lies <i>safety</i>; in the opposite, <i>danger</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that a note of the Time
Convention Committee, attached to the rule
and here shown, indicates that the adoption of
either form or both is discretionary with
roads adopting the "Standard" rules, and
that it is suggested that it may be provided
that operators shall take the signatures of
trainmen for "19" orders. These would be
simply evidence of delivery, and the signatures
would not, under this arrangement, be telegraphed
to headquarters.</p>

<p>The question as to when it is best or proper
to use the "19" order must be determined by
circumstances. Taking and transmitting the
signatures is intended to secure deliberate care
in the delivery and certainty that the order is
delivered to the right train.</p>

<p>The first is reasonably certain when the
trainmen are required to go to the office and
sign for the order; the second is determined
by the transmission of the signatures. Those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
who use the "19" order must leave both these
points to the care of the operator. If operators
are thoroughly drilled and under constant
and careful supervision, and so fully occupied
with the work as to be necessarily always
on the alert, this dependence is more
likely to result favorably than where discipline
is slack and business dull, and especially
where the operator is required to attend to
other duties. Circumstances may often seem
to require the delivery of an order without
signatures where the contrary is the usual
custom. It would be necessary in such case
to use special precautions in instructing the
operator, and it should scarcely be allowed
without special authority from the responsible
head.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 512.</span>—For an order preceded by the signal "19," "complete"
must be given and acknowledged for the train of superior
right before it is given for the train of inferior right.</p>

<p>If the line fails <i>before an office has received and acknowledged
the</i> "<i>complete</i>" to an order preceded by the signal "19,"
the order at that office is of no effect, and must be treated as
if it had not been sent.</p></div>

<p>This rule is for the "19" order what Rule
510 is for the other, and no additional remarks
are needed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 513.</span>—The order, the "O K" and the "complete"
must each, in transmitting, be preceded by "31" or "19," as
the case may be, and the number of the order; thus, "31,
No. 10," or "19, No. 10." In transmitting the signature of a
conductor it must be preceded by "31," the number of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
order, and the train number; thus, "31, No. 10, Train No. 5."
After each transmission and response the sending operator
must give his office signal.</p></div>

<p>Here is prescribed the succession in which
the signals, etc., shall be transmitted. For the
"office signal," which the operator is required
to give after each transmission and response,
some substitute the personal signal of the operator,
which is usually one or more letters assigned,
by which the operator shall be known,
and indicates at the same time the operator and
the office where he is known to be on duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 514.</span>—The operator who receives and delivers an order
must preserve the lowest copy. On this must appear the
signatures of those who sign for the order, and on it he must
record the time when he receives it; the responses; the time
when they are received; his own name; the date; and the
train number; for which places are provided in the blanks.
These copies must be sent to the Superintendent.</p></div>

<p>The subjects treated of in this rule have been
sufficiently considered in former remarks.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 515.</span>—Orders used by conductors must be sent by
them daily to the Superintendent.</p></div>

<p>This provision affords an opportunity of examining
orders that have been used, and of ascertaining
whether they have been prepared
and issued in accordance with the rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 516.</span>—Enginemen will place their orders in the clip
before them until executed.</p></div>

<p>This rule supposes that a place has been provided
on each engine for placing orders conspicuously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
before the engineman who is to execute
them. This is a very important provision.
If he has to put them in his box or
pocket they may be rendered illegible, or forgotten
or lost.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 517.</span>—For orders delivered at the Superintendent's
office the requirements as to record and delivery will be the
same as at other points.</p></div>

<p>This requirement would seem to be so obvious
that it was hardly necessary to include it
in the rules, but for the fact that there has
been some oversight of so manifest a precaution.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 518.</span>—Orders to persons in charge of work requiring
the use of track in yards or at other points, authorizing such
use when trains are late, must be delivered in the same way
as to conductors of trains.</p></div>

<p>This rule recognizes the fact that the same
care is necessary in giving the use of the track
in the time of regular trains, whether it be to
a yard crew or a train on the road. Carelessness
in this respect, by men working at stations,
has frequently resulted in disaster. The
sacredness of the "rights" of trains should be
an integral part of railway doctrine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 519.</span>—An order to be delivered to a train at a point
not a telegraph station, or while the office is closed, must be
addressed to</p>

<p>"<i>C. and E.</i>, <i>No.</i> —— (<i>at</i> ——), <i>care of</i> ——,"
and forwarded and delivered by the conductor or other person
in whose care it is addressed. "Complete" will be given
upon the signature of the person by whom the order is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
delivered, who must be supplied with copies for the conductor
and engineman addressed, and a copy upon which he
shall take their signatures. This copy he must deliver to the
first operator accessible, who must preserve it, and at once
advise the Train Dispatcher of its having been received.</p>

<p>Orders so delivered to a train must be compared by those
receiving them with the copy held by the person delivering,
and acted on as if "complete" had been given in the
ordinary way.</p>

<p>Orders must not be sent in the manner herein provided
to trains the rights of which are thereby restricted.</p></div>

<p>The subject of delivery of orders at points
away from telegraph stations has already been
considered. The method of doing this is here
determined.</p>

<p>Safety in carrying this out must depend
largely on the carefulness of the person selected
to deliver the order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 520.</span>—When a train is named in an order, all its sections
are included, unless particular sections are specified;
and each section included must have copies addressed and
delivered to it.</p></div>

<p>This rule is based on the fact that all sections
of a train are substantially one train, so far as
schedule rights are concerned. This is definitely
fixed by the "Standard" train rules.
This rule provides that each section included
in the operation of an order must have copies.
Instances might be cited where this would
seem unnecessary.</p>

<p>A delayed train may be ordered to meet a
superior train at some point short of the meeting-point.
Without any order each section
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
of the superior train would have a right to go
to the designated point, and it may be supposed
that, if the first section is held by the
order at that point for the inferior, the other
sections cannot go by until the inferior is out
of the way. While this may be true, circumstances
may arise even in this case that would
render it important that each section should
know of the movement. The difficulty of
specifying in a rule the cases in which the provision
might be omitted probably led to
making the rule absolute. It is pointed out,
however, by practical men that serious and
needless delays may often arise from strict
adherence to the rule, and that in certain cases
there can be no danger from giving the order
to the leading section only. It is quite possible
that the rule may admit of some amendment
in this respect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 521.</span>—Meeting-orders must not be sent for delivery
to trains at the meeting-point if it can be avoided. When
it cannot be avoided, special precautions must be taken
by the Train Dispatchers and operators to insure safety.</p>

<p>There should be, if possible, at least one telegraph office between
those at which opposing trains receive meeting-orders.</p>

<p>Orders should not be sent an unnecessarily long time before
delivery, or to points unnecessarily distant from where they
are to be executed. No orders (except those affecting the
train at that point) should be delivered to a freight train
at a station where it has much work, until after the work
is done.</p></div>

<p>Here it is wisely provided that trains shall,
if possible, be advised of their place of meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
before reaching it. It is scarcely necessary
to point out the obvious reasons for this, arising
from the possibility of a train, on arrival, passing
the switch where the meeting is intended
to be. The first and second paragraphs both
suggest the advantage of being able to communicate
with a train in the event of a desire to
change an order or of an error having been
found to have occurred on the part of a train
or in the preparation or transmission of an
order. The third paragraph is to guard against
men forgetting orders delivered to them,
through lapse of time or preoccupation in their
work, and also against the necessity of changing
orders issued long in advance of the time
at which they are expected to be used, when a
new set of circumstances may have arisen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 522.</span>—A train, or any section of a train, must be governed
strictly by the terms of orders addressed to it, and
must not assume rights not conferred by such orders. In all
other respects it must be governed by the train rules and
time-table.</p></div>

<p>To some disciplinarians the provisions of
this rule would seem to be unnecessary. To
say that a thing means what it says and no more
would seem to be superfluous, and yet the
vital importance of the point, and the fact that
it has been often disregarded, warrant this enforcement
of it. A case in point came not long
since to the author's knowledge. A rule in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
the book of a certain road required that "all
trains must slow up at meeting-points with
trains of any class." The rule was intended
to apply to schedule meeting-points, and was
so generally understood, notwithstanding the
indefiniteness of the designation. An order
was given requiring a superior train to wait
until a time stated for the arrival of an inferior
train at a point reached by the superior train
before its arrival at the schedule meeting-point.
The inferior train not arriving by the
time stated, the superior train went on and
passed the schedule meeting-point without
slackening speed, as required by the rule. The
inferior train was there and not quite out of
the way, and a collision occurred. The conductor
and engineman of the superior train
claimed that the order to meet had done away
with the schedule meeting-point, and therefore
the rule did not apply, whereas the order was
provisional, and was completely fulfilled when
the inferior train failed to arrive and the
superior train went on past the point named
in the order without meeting the other. The
inferior, being unable to reach the given point
by the time stated, ran on its rights and
stopped at the schedule meeting-point, respecting
which the order had made no mention.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that while the indefiniteness
of the rule may have been partly chargeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
with the wrong view taken by the trainmen,
a strict construction would make it applicable
to every point that became a "meeting-point,"
whether under the operation of the
rules or of special orders. A rule capable of
these different constructions is fatally defective.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 523.</span>—Orders once in effect continue so until fulfilled,
superseded, or annulled. Orders held by or issued for a
regular train which has lost its rights, as provided by Rule
107, are annulled, and other trains will be governed accordingly.</p>
</div>

<p>The first provision in this rule is also one
that would seem scarcely necessary, but for
the importance of emphasizing this point.
Future experience and training may render it
needless to include so simple a statement in
these rules.</p>

<p>Train Rule 107, referred to in the second
sentence, provides that a regular train 12
hours behind time loses all its rights, and is
practically annulled.</p>

<p>The expiration of orders, with the expiration,
under the rules, of the entire rights of a
train which has received them, is a necessary
consequence, although to some it might not
be sufficiently clear without this authoritative
statement.</p>

<p>The statement that, under these circumstances,
orders "are annulled," leaves the
mind in doubt as to whether they are simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
annulled by the state of facts or by the process
provided for annulling orders. In the publication
of these rules as adopted by the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company this doubt is removed
by modifying the language to read,
"Orders held by or issued for a regular train
are to be considered as annulled when the
train has lost its rights, as provided by Rule
No. 107, and other trains will be governed
accordingly."</p>

<p>The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio road adds to Train
Rule 107 a provision that a train having the
right of track may take to a telegraph station
a train that under this rule has lost the right
to proceed. This seems a good provision, as
such train has no right to proceed even as an
extra, and under many circumstances the Dispatcher
would have difficulty in getting control
of a train without this help. The discussion
of this belongs, however, more properly
with the consideration of train rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 524</span> (A)—A fixed signal must be used at each train-order
office, which shall display red at all times when there
is an operator on duty, except when changed to white to
allow a train to pass after getting orders, or for which there
are no orders.</p>

<p>When red is displayed all trains must come to a full stop,
and not proceed as long as red is displayed. The signal must
be returned to red as soon as a train has passed. It must
only be fastened at white when no operator is on duty. This
signal must also display red to hold trains running in the
same direction the required time apart. Operators must be
prepared with other signals to use promptly if the fixed signal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
should fail to work properly. If a signal is not displayed
at a night office, trains which have not been previously
notified must stop and inquire the cause, and report the
facts to the superintendent from the next open telegraph
office.</p>

<p>When a semaphore is used, the arm means red when horizontal
and white when in an inclined position.</p>
</div>

<div class="pmt2 blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 524</span> (B)—A fixed signal must be used at each train-order
office, which shall display red when trains are to be
stopped for orders. When there are no orders the signal
must display white.</p>

<p>When an operator receives the signal "31" or "19," he
must <i>immediately</i> display red, and <i>then</i> reply "red displayed."
The signal must not be changed to white until the
object for which red is displayed is accomplished.</p>

<p>While red is displayed all trains must come to a full stop,
and any train thus stopped must not proceed without receiving
an order addressed to such train, or a clearance card
on a specified form, stating, over the operator's signature,
that he has no orders for it. Operators must be prepared
with other signals to use promptly if the fixed signal should
fail to work properly. If a signal is not displayed at a
night office, trains which have not been previously notified
must stop and inquire the cause, and report the facts to
the superintendent from the next open telegraph office.</p>

<p>When a semaphore is used, the arm means red when horizontal
and white when in an inclined position.</p>
</div>

<p>Rules 524(A) and 524(B) refer to the character
and operation of the train-order signal, and in
the original report of the committee they are
accompanied by a note indicating that the
adoption of either or both forms of the rule is
to be discretionary, according to the circumstances
of traffic.</p>

<p>Both recognize the value of the "fixed"
signal, instead of hand signals, and its necessity
for the proper carrying out of the rules.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
The difference between the two forms of the
rule is that the former provides that the signal
shall stand constantly at "danger," excepting
when changed to another position to
permit a train to pass, while with the latter
the normal position is at "safety," the other
to be shown only when an order is to be
sent.</p>

<p>Under the first plan a train approaching a
station must stop unless the signal is seen to
have been changed from its normal position of
"danger" to that of "safety"—from red to
white. The operator in this case moves the
signal and this is an indication that there are
no orders for that train, although there may
be for others.</p>

<p>The presence of an order in the hands of an
operator does not, under this method, require
that all trains passing shall stop. Under the
other plan the signal at red indicates that the
operator has orders in his hands, and no train
can be allowed to pass by the simple moving
of the signal, but each, on arrival, must stop
and get orders, or a "clearance card" stating
that there are no orders for it.</p>

<p>Some considerations respecting these two
methods have already been advanced, and they
need not be repeated here. There does not
seem to be any substantial reason why the
practice of permitting a train to pass, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
movement of the signal, might not be used in
connection with the plan of "normal at safety"
as well as with the other, and the author is
under the impression that this is done on some
roads.</p>

<p>The rule wisely requires a provision of other
signals for prompt use in case the fixed signal
fails to work. The machinery may break or
the lights go out; and to see that this precaution
is observed is an important duty of the
officer having direct supervision of these matters.
The non-display of a usual night signal is
recognized as a reason for inquiry and caution.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 525.</span>—Operators will promptly record and report to
the Superintendent the time of the departure of all trains
and the direction in which extra trains are moving. They
will record the time of arrival of trains and report it when
so directed.</p></div>

<p>The records and reports here required are
important as a means of information for the
Dispatcher and as a check on operators and
trains as well as a part of the permanent record.
Suitable blanks must be provided for these
records.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 526.</span>—Regular trains will be designated in orders by
their schedule numbers, as "No. 10" or "2nd No. 10," adding
engine numbers if desired; extra trains by engine numbers,
as "Extra 798"; and all other numbers by figures.
The direction of the movement of extras will be added
when necessary, as "East" or "West." Time will be
stated in figures only.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In case any roads desire to state time in words as well as
figures, the Committee sees no objection to their doing so.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 527.</span>—The following signs and abbreviations may be
used:</p>

<p>Initials for Superintendent's signature.</p>

<p>Such office and other signals as are arranged by the Superintendent.</p>

<p>C &amp; E—for Conductor and Engineman.</p>

<p>O K—as provided in these rules.</p>

<p>Min—for Minutes.</p>

<p>Junc—for Junction.</p>

<p>Frt—for Freight.</p>

<p>Opr—for Operator.</p>

<p>9—to clear the line for Train Orders, and for Operators
to ask for Train Orders.</p>

<p>31 or 19—for Train Order, as provided in the rules.</p>

<p>The usual abbreviations for the names of the months and
stations.</p></div>

<p>Rules 526 and 527 prescribe the mode of
designating trains and the use of figures, signs,
and abbreviations, with option as to figures,
in a note under Rule 526. Uniformity in these
matters is important for clearness of understanding
and economy and expedition in telegraphing.</p>

<p>It is a question how far abbreviations may
properly be used in train telegraphing. They
certainly should be admitted only when they
can be shown not to interfere with a safe understanding
of orders. Initials for the signatures
of Superintendent or Dispatcher and operators
may be used, but they would hardly be admissible
for the signatures of trainmen. The latter
may very properly be addressed as "C. and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
E." The "O K" for "all right" is an established
signal, not requiring a dictionary to interpret
it.</p>

<p>Min for minute, junc for junction, exp for
express, frt for freight, eng for engine, No
for number, K for o'clock, sec for section,
opr for operator, cannot mislead.</p>

<p>For inquiries and replies respecting the work,
many codes have been constructed wherein
each is represented by a number or a word, and
the telegraphing thus abbreviated.</p>

<p>It will probably never be settled to the
satisfaction of everybody whether numbers
should be represented in figures or written out
in full. The opinion of practical men has been
lately growing more favorable to figures, although
some adhere rigidly to writing out
numbers in words. The "Standard" rules
favor figures. Much depends of course on the
training of the operators. Figures are unmistakable
if properly made, while a long number
written out in full may be so poorly written
as to confuse the reader. Where a single
figure occurs in describing a section of a train
as 2nd, 3rd, etc., it is easy to take the one for
the other, both in telegraphing and in the
written figures, and it is wise to write these
out. The numbers of trains and of engines are
not so liable to be confused with others in their
immediate neighborhood, and it would appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
to be entirely proper to use figures to represent
them.</p>

<p>The designation of trains is usually by numbers.
This is more definite and more brief
than by any other time-table title, as "local
freight," "Chicago express," etc. An extra
train is probably best described by the engine
name or number, as there is usually nothing
else about a train so definite as this. Some add
the names of conductors and enginemen.
Where there is any danger of one train being
mistaken for another, the engine number
should be used, and care taken against mistakes
arising from change of engines.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">FORMS OF TRAIN ORDERS.</p>


<p>The advantage of pre-arranged forms of
train orders for the cases ordinarily occurring
has been already adverted to, and is now
fully recognized. Forms should be brief. A
multitude of words is confusing. They are
not so easily read; while a short form, with a
uniformly well understood meaning, is comprehended
at a glance. To know what it intends
becomes a part of the education of a
railroad man. For this reason it would be a
great advance if this service could be everywhere
conducted on the same plans. Brevity
also economizes time in telegraphing, which is
of great importance on a busy wire. In a conversation
carried on by a company of persons
several may speak at once, or nearly so, and
things go smoothly along, but on a wire only
one can speak at a time, and hence the time
each communication may occupy becomes important.</p>

<p>All men, however, do not quickly catch an
idea when its expression is reduced to the simplest
form. This is, sometimes, because it is
new, or it may be from lack of training, or
even natural dullness, or because human nature
is so constituted that men view the simplest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
things in different lights. To provide
against all contingencies of this kind, and to
explain to men the proper understanding as
well as to settle it authoritatively, explanatory
rules are needed, with definite instructions
as to how orders are to be interpreted.
These may be studied at leisure and discussed
and mutually understood by the men. The
need of these rules does not arise from any incompleteness
in the forms of orders. A signal
for a given purpose is sufficient in itself,
but it is necessary to state the purpose which
it is designed to serve. A word expresses a
definite thought, but we may have to turn to
the dictionary to learn what that thought is.
Another and highly important service of such
explanatory rules is that they beget confidence,
on the ground that all understand alike.</p>

<p>It has been before urged that a separate
order should be given for each separate transaction.
This, however, need not be pressed
to extremes. Circumstances may arise in
which forms may be combined with advantage.
For instance, an order may be given:</p>

<div class="center">
<i>Engine 530 will run extra to Brighton, and
will meet train No. 2 at Lisbon.</i>
</div>

<p>This serves the purpose of an "extra" order
and of a "meeting" order, and is not in any
way confusing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinarily there is little to be gained by departing
from the general rule laid down, but
experience and good judgment will soon determine
where it will be proper, if the principles
upon which safety may depend are kept
steadily in view.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to introduce
printed blanks for the several forms of orders,
with spaces for the words which vary with
each case, such words only to be telegraphed.
This plan does not appear, however, to have
met with much favor. The brevity possible in
forms is such that little is saved by this
method, in the amount of telegraphing. The
words sent are disconnected and unsatisfactory,
and the care and attention required in
having a number of books on the operator's
table from which to select the proper form
would be considerable, especially if the manifold
is used. A supposed advantage is in
having explanatory rules printed on each
blank. It is better to have these printed
together with all the forms for circulation
among the employés, who can then discuss
and become familiar with them and come to a
uniform understanding as to their meaning.</p>

<p>Much variety has existed in the forms of
orders in use. Prior to the quite general
adoption of the "Standard" code there were
probably no two roads on which they were in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
all respects alike. This lack of uniformity
was unfortunate, and some of these variations
assumed serious importance in view of the
time occupied in telegraphing superfluous
words. A very few forms suffice for the most
of the orders issued.</p>

<p>Those here considered are the forms issued
with and forming a part of the Time Convention
Rules. They are the same in principle as
those given in the former edition of The Train
Wire, and not greatly different in their construction.
Some have been amplified and some
additions have been made.</p>

<p>They will be considered under the following
classification:</p>

<p class="p8">A. For trains meeting.</p>
<p class="p8">B. For trains passing.</p>
<p class="p8">C. Reversing rights of trains.</p>
<p class="p8">D. Movements regulated by time.</p>
<p class="p8">E. For running in sections.</p>
<p class="p8">F. For extra trains.</p>
<p class="p8">G. For annulling trains.</p>
<p class="p8">H. For annulling an order.</p>
<p class="p8">I. Holding orders.</p>

<p>Practice may suggest additional forms or
combinations of these.</p>

<p>In these forms trains are designated by numbers,
it being understood that those of odd
numbers move in one direction and have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
right of track as against opposing trains of
even numbers, and that the train rules fix this
as well as which train shall ordinarily take
the siding.</p>

<p>It will be understood that all orders are addressed
in the manner required by the rules,
including in the address the places where the
order is to be delivered, thus:</p>

<p class="p8">C. &amp; E. train No. 1, Paris.</p>
<p class="p8">C. &amp; E. train No. 2, Madrid.</p>

<p>The forms are accompanied by examples of
their use, with variations for different cases
and explanatory notes or rules, all being a
part of the "Standard" rules. Following
each are the author's remarks:</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_A" name="Form_A"></a>Form A.—Fixing Meeting-Point for Opposing Trains.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">—— and —— will meet at ——.</p>

<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p class="p8"><i>No. 1 and No. 2 will meet at Bombay.</i></p>

<p class="p8"><i>No. 3 and 2nd No. 4 will meet at Siam.</i></p>

<p class="p8"><i>No. 5 and Extra 95 will meet at Hong Kong.</i></p>

<p class="p8"><i>Extra 652 North and Extra 231 South will meet at Yokohama.</i></p>

<p>Trains receiving this order will, with respect to each other,
run to the designated point, and having arrived there will
pass in the manner provided by the Rules.</p></div>

<p>This order is usually given to designate a
definite meeting-place at which the trains
would not meet under the operation of the
time-table and train rules. No. 2 has no right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">« 102 »</a></span>
pass the regular meeting-place if No. 1 is late,
until it has arrived; and No. 2. would hence in
such case be delayed unless an order is given
authorizing it to proceed.</p>

<p>If No. 2 is too late to reach the regular meeting-place
before No. 1 may leave, it must, by
the rules keep out of the way of No. 1 by waiting
at some other point, but an order enables
it to run with confidence, without time clearance,
to a new meeting-place. It may happen
that an order will be useful authorizing trains
to meet at their regular meeting-place, when
both are behind time or when the inferior train
is not much late. In any case it avoids the
necessity for allowing any time for clearance.
It is not necessary to add to the form of the
order as given above, as has been sometimes
done, "and pass according to rule." The order
should not be burdened with this. The rules
respecting train orders should always provide,
as above, that <i>trains ordered to meet at a designated
point will both run to that point, and
having arrived there will pass each other in
the manner provided by the rules, unless
otherwise indicated in the order</i>. This settles
the question, which has been raised, of the
sufficiency of this form of order, and also renders
unnecessary the expression "meet and
pass." The word "pass" is best reserved for
use in connection with a train going around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
another moving in the same direction, and it
would seem unnecessary to direct trains meeting
each other to "pass," as they cannot proceed
without passing; and the rules should
prescribe the method. This positive meeting-order
is generally deemed the safest form of
order for opposing trains, as it leaves no room
for doubt or calculation in determining how
the order is to be executed. In the use of this
order for trains of several sections it must be
held to apply to all the sections, unless otherwise
specified, and each section that is included
in the operation of the order should be referred
to and is required by the "Standard" rules to
have copies.</p>

<p>If the different sections are to be met at
different places, separate orders are best. In
the forms contained in a book of rules which
appears to have been carefully prepared, is
found the following for a train or a section of a
train which is to meet one of several sections:</p>

<p>"Train No. — will meet and pass —— sections
of train No. — as follows: first section
No. —, at ——; second section, at ——; third
section, at ——."</p>

<p>Some of the objections urged against the practice
of including several meeting-points in one
order, under the "single order" system, apply
equally to this. The whole of this order must
be transcribed for and delivered to each section,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
and each conductor and engineman must
acquaint himself with the whole, while but
one train is concerned with all of it. The men
of each of the sections named must carefully
pick out what belongs to them, and those of
the first train must exercise great care to avoid
missing any of the points named. It will be
found vastly better and safer to give a separate
order for each meeting.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_B" name="Form_B">Form B.</a> Authorizing a Train to Run Ahead of or Pass
Another Train Running in the Same Direction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">(1.) —— will pass —— at ——.</p>

<p class="p8">(2.) —— will run ahead of ——, from —— to ——.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p class="p8">(1.) <i>No. 1 will pass No. 3 at Khartoum.</i></p>

<p class="p8">(2.) <i>No. 4 will run ahead of No. 6 from Bengal to Madras.</i></p>

<p>When under this order a train is to pass another, both
trains will run according to rule to the designated point and
there arrange for the rear train to pass promptly.</p></div>

<p>Referring to Example 1, if train No. 1 is
superior to No. 3, the rules should give it the
right to pass, as No. 3 must keep out of its
way and no order would be required. If No.
3 is the superior and is for any reason running
slower than No. 1 and it is desired to permit
the latter to pass, an order of this kind is
needed. A regular freight train may be in the
way of a special passenger train which it is
necessary should pass the freight. The order
may also be needed for two extras or for regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
trains of equal class. If the train passed is the
superior, the order does not in terms fully convey
to the other all the right needed. Having
passed, it may be for some time, or at a subsequent
period, within the time of the superior
train, and it hence would <i>by the train rules</i>
be required in turn to clear the track for a
train which it had passed a short time before.
A fair inference is that, if allowed to pass, it
is of course to proceed ahead of the other, but
if this is not clearly understood or fixed by a
rule, the form of the order should be modified
for such cases either by adding, "and will run
ahead from there," or by making it read as in
Example 2 indicating the point <i>to</i> as well as
that <i>from</i> which the train specified is to "run
ahead" of the other.</p>

<p>This variation is also for authorizing a train
to run ahead of and in the time of another
from some point at which the other has not
arrived. The point <i>to</i> which it shall so run is
to be omitted when it is not desired to impose
such limitation.</p>

<p>Under this use of the order No. 6 is assumed
to be late, and No. 4, an inferior train waiting
for it, is allowed to proceed in its time. No. 6
may be a first-class passenger train waiting
for connections, and No. 4 may be a
local freight train which is enabled by this
order to proceed with its work; or perhaps it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
may be a train starting from some way-station
or junction at which the rules would require
it to wait for No. 6 to pass. No. 6 is to assume
that the other may be ahead at any
point beyond that named in the order, and
run accordingly. The Dispatcher of course
provides, by giving more definite orders as
soon as he can do so, that no unnecessary delay
arises to the superior train from the operation
of the order.</p>

<p>The train rules should make it clear that
<i>when a train is authorized to "run ahead" of
another by special order, the train following
must guard against collision with the train
ahead, as during the operation of the order
their relative rights as to superiority (when
any existed) are reversed</i>.</p>

<p>An order giving a train the right to use a
given number of minutes in the time of a superior
train going in the same direction, comes
properly under "time-orders."</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_C" name="Form_C">Form C.</a>—Giving a Train of Inferior Right the Right of
Track Against an Opposing Train of Superior Right.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">———— has right of track against ——— ——— to ———.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p class="p8">(1) <i>No. 2 has right of track against No. 1, Mecca to Mirbat.</i></p>

<p class="p8">(2) <i>Extra 37 has right of track against No. 3, Natal to
Ratlam.</i></p>

<p>This order gives a train of inferior right the right of track
against one of superior right to a designated point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span></p>

<p>If the trains meet at the designated point, the train of
inferior right must take the siding, unless the rules or orders
otherwise indicate.</p>

<p>Under this order, as illustrated by example (1), if the train
of superior right reaches the designated point before the
other arrives, it may proceed, provided it keeps clear of the
schedule time of the train of inferior right as many minutes
as the inferior train was before required by the train rules to
keep clear of the superior train.</p>

<p>If the train of superior right, before meeting, reaches a
point beyond that named in the order, the conductor must
stop the other train where it is met and inform it of his
arrival.</p>

<p>Under example (2) the train of superior right cannot go
beyond the designated point until the extra train arrives.</p>

<p>When the train of inferior right has reached the designated
point, the order is fulfilled, and the train must
then be governed by time-table and train-rules or further
orders.</p>

<p>The following modification of this form of order will
be applicable for giving a work train the right of track
over all other trains in case of a wreck or break in the
track:—</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p class="p8"><i>Work Train Extra 275 has right of track over all trains
between Stockholm and Edinburgh from 7 P. M.</i> ——.</p>

<p>This gives the work train the exclusive right of the track
between the points designated.</p>
</div>

<p>This form is equivalent in effect to that
known as the "Regardless" order, which
reads thus:</p>

<div class="center">
"<i>No. 2 will run to (Lyons) regardless of No. 1.</i>"
</div>

<p>The term "regardless," although having
something of a reckless sound, has been taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
as exactly indicating the purport of this order,
viz.: that a train is to cease to regard certain
rights of another which are conferred by the
rules, but are suspended or abrogated by this
order. Here, as in other duplicate orders, it is
understood that <i>a new right conferred upon
one train takes away or limits a right of some
other train</i>; and that an order allowing a
train to run regardless of another requires the
latter to keep out of the way.</p>

<p>It was thought best, and is certainly an improvement,
to dispense with the old designation
and adopt for this order a title and
phraseology indicating its purport more specifically.</p>

<p>The ordinary use of this order is to advance
a train to a point within the time of one
superior to it, when there may be uncertainty
as to the trains actually meeting there. The
trains would usually proceed expecting to
meet, but anticipating possible new orders.
If the Dispatcher thinks he is likely to have
further orders, he may find it best to add,
"and ask for further orders." This will bring
the trainmen at once to the office on arrival if
the opposing train is not seen. A positive
meeting-order is to be preferred to this form
when it will as well serve the purpose. A
note to this effect was proposed in the Time
Convention, but it was finally determined that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
this should be left to the discretion of operating
officers.</p>

<p>The use of this order for a train "running
ahead," as proposed in the former edition of
The Train Wire, is unnecessary with the second
example under <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#Form_B">Form B.</a></p>

<p>The effect of an order in Form C is to reverse
for a time or for certain parts of the track the
relations of trains as respects superiority of
right. Some have failed to perceive that, under
certain circumstances, it will be proper for a
train mentioned in this order to leave the designated
point before the other has arrived.</p>

<p>This point is settled by the rules with the
form, but it may not be altogether clear to
some that the conclusion is correct. The following
will perhaps make it clear:</p>

<p>Let A, B and C in the following diagram
represent three stations, of which B is the
schedule meeting-point of two trains running
in the directions indicated, No. 1 being the
superior train and having the right to run on
its own time beyond B if No. 2 has not arrived.</p>

<p class="center">
A……………B……………C<br>
No. 1<img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Train Wire, by J. A. Anderson_files/fingers.png" width="331" height="29" alt="fingers pointing">No. 2.<br>
</p>

<p>Both trains are due at B at the same time.
If No. 1 is late before arriving at A an order is
given:</p>

<p class="center">"<i>No. 2 has right of track against No. 1
from B to A.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span></p>

<p>Under this order No. 2 becomes temporarily
superior to No. 1, and obtains the right to run
to A on its own time without regard to the
time or rights of No. 1. On the arrival of the
latter at A it may be found to have made up
so much time that it can proceed toward B
and reach that or some intermediate point before
No. 2 can, on its own schedule time, reach
such point. May it do so? There is clearly
nothing in the order or in the rules to prevent.
No. 1 is, for the time being, the inferior
train. It is in the position of a train having
no rights against No. 2, and must be governed
by that fact. But any train inferior to No. 2
may go from A to B or to any point if it can
clear No. 2 in accordance with the rules. It
should be held as a cardinal principle in
train dispatching that <i>an order is not to
be taken as having greater effect than is
actually expressed</i>. In the order in question
one train is directed to run to a point without
respect to the rights of another. This annuls
the rights of the one <i>as respects the regular
time of the other</i> for the portion of the track
designated. The rights are simply reversed.
No. 1 is now required to keep clear of the time
of No. 2 as laid down in the time-table, with as
much clearance as the train rules required of
No. 2 as respects the time of No. 1 before the
order was given. It cannot be supposed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>
No. 2 may possibly run ahead of time from B.
This could only be done on an order to do so
duplicated to No. 1 and to any other train
affected by it.</p>

<p>If B is the point given in the order, no such
question can arise as to either train, as each is
due at the same time. If, however, C is the
given point, it is upon the assumption that
No. 2 is too late to get farther than C without
interference with No. 1. If No. 2 makes up
time, so that on reaching C it is found that it
has time to go farther and still keep clear of
No. 1, as required by the rules, its schedule
rights will admit of this, and the order does
not in any way interfere with them excepting
in adding to them what is supposed to be required
to enable the train to reach C.</p>

<p>It would appear then that when an order
gives a train of inferior right the right of track
to a given point against a superior train, the
train arriving first at the designated point may
go beyond it, before the other arrives, to any
point where it can clear the regular time of
the opposing train the number of minutes required.
The train thus passing the given point
must run as the inferior of the two until the
other is met, and should be required, as in
the rule, to clear the other by as much as the
train rules prescribe for clearance of similar
trains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span></p>

<p>As a further illustration of this question,
suppose that a general order were issued giving
to a regular train the right of track against
all other trains. It is not to be supposed that
this would prevent other trains from running,
excepting as they might fall into the time of
the train to which this right was given. Or
the order under Form D giving all trains the
right of track against a given train, does not
prevent the designated train from running
freely where it does not get in the way of other
regular trains.</p>

<p>It is evident that this form of order differs
from the "meeting" order in this important
respect, that under certain circumstances trains
may meet at some other point than that named
in the order, and that it may be said that
"when either train has reached the point
designated in this order, it may proceed, if it
can do so without trespassing on the schedule
time of the other." The point is further illustrated
under the operation of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#Form_D">Form D.</a></p>

<p>It is evident that, if the inferior train is an
extra, it has no schedule time by which the
superior train can be guided, and hence the
latter, as provided by the rule, cannot go beyond
the designated point until the extra has
arrived.</p>

<p>The careful discussion of the question here
involved is justified by the fact that practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
men hold different views respecting it, and
many rules determine it differently or leave it
wholly or partly unsettled. The fact that
there is a considerable diversity of opinion
upon so important a point, indicates that the
course to be pursued under the circumstances
should be clearly set forth in the rules. A
rule should not, however, be made to add to
the effect of an order. It is usually only
needed by way of explanation or to authoritatively
determine that upon which a doubt may
exist. It may occur to some that the trains
meeting at an unexpected point may not recognize
each other as the trains designated in
the order. It must be presumed that conductors
will observe all trains met, and knowing
what regular trains are due will know when
they have met them, and not wait elsewhere
for them; and that extras are distinguished
from regular trains by proper signals.</p>

<p>To avoid delays, however, a provision is
made that a train of superior right reaching a
point beyond that designated in the order before
meeting the other train, must notify the
latter when it is met. As in that case the
train of superior right has not the right of
track, it must take the siding where it meets
the train which has been given the right of
track against it. When the train of inferior
right arrives at the point designated in the order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
before meeting the other, the order is fulfilled;
and having no longer the right of track
it must take the siding at that point or at such
other point as it may reach under the operation
of the rules in time to clear the train of
superior right.</p>

<p>An order in Form C with time limit is objectionable,
as there is danger of overlooking
the time limit. It is better to use a distinct
form for time orders.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_D" name="Form_D">Form D.</a>—Giving all Regular Trains the Right of Track
Over a Given Train.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">All regular trains have right of track against ——
between —— and ——.</p>

<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLE.</p>


<p class="p8"><i>All regular trains have right of track against No. 1 between
Moscow and Berlin.</i></p>

<p>This order gives to any regular train of inferior right receiving
it the right of track over the train named in the order,
and the latter must clear the schedule times of all regular
trains, the same as if it were an extra.</p></div>

<p>This form involves the same principles as
the last, and might have been included under
the same general head but for the wish to
give it greater distinctness. The use of "over"
in the title and the rule, instead of "against"
used elsewhere, is probably the result of oversight.</p>

<p>No form was presented by the Convention
Committee for giving to a given train the right
of track against all regular trains. If circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
require, such an order can of course
be given on the same plan as others involving
the same principles.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_E" name="Form_E">Form E.</a>—Time Orders.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">(1.) —— will run —— late from —— to ——.</p>

<p class="p8">(2.) —— will wait at —— until —— for ——.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>


<p class="p8">(1.) <i>No. 1 will run 20 min. late from Joppa to Mainz.</i></p>

<p class="p8">(2.) <i>No. 1 will wait at Muscat until 10 A. M. for No. 2.</i></p>

<p>Form (1) makes the schedule time of the train named, between
the points mentioned, as much later as the time stated
in the order, and any other train receiving the order is required
to run, with respect to this later time, the same as before
required to run, with respect to the regular schedule
time. The time in the order should be such as can be easily
added to the schedule time.</p>

<p>Under Form (2) the train of superior right must not pass
the designated point before the time given, unless the other
train has arrived. The train of inferior right is required
to run with respect to the time specified, the same as
before required to run with respect to the regular schedule
time of the train of superior right.</p>
</div>

<p>The character and effect of these two forms
of Time Orders are sufficiently clear from the
explanatory rules. The first simply sets back
a schedule and the second is positive as to the
time to which the superior train must wait.
There might have been added a form authorizing
an inferior train to use a given number of
minutes of the time of a superior train.
This would have applied to any point. The
effect would have been, for the particular inferior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
train, the same as under Example 1 for
all trains. It was probably concluded that, if
a train was to run late, all others should have
the benefit, and that there would be no particular
advantage in a form for but one train.
The time-limit feature appears also in Forms
G and H.</p>

<p>Many object to time-orders. They are certainly
not as definite as a positive meeting-order,
and for this reason, and because there is a
chance of error in the calculations required,
they are not to be preferred. A time-table,
however, is a "time order," and it is not always
possible to avoid directing trains to run
with reference to time. A judicious Dispatcher
will discriminate as to the cases in which he
should do this. In all cases such even number
of minutes or hours should be given as will reduce
to a minimum the risk of making the
necessary addition or subtraction. The risk
of a time order and of all running on time,
arises largely from the possibility of trainmen
not having the correct time. The allowance
of five minutes for difference in watches
does not appear to answer the purpose for
which it is designed, as men will trespass on
this. The objections made to time orders appear
to be overcome as far as possible by the
forms presented, and now generally adopted,
with the present excellence of time-keepers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
the precautions insisted on for preserving them
in good condition.</p>

<p class="p8"><i>2nd No. 1 will carry signals London to Dover for Eng. 90.</i></p>

<p>This may be modified as follows:</p>

<p class="p8"><i>Engines 70, 85, and 90 will run as 1st, 2d and 3d sections of

<p>If there are other sections following add:</p>

<p class="p8"><i>Following sections will change numbers accordingly.</i></p>

<p>The character of train for which signals are carried may
be stated. Each section affected by the order must
have copies, and must arrange signals accordingly.</p>
</div>

<p>When two or more trains are run on the
same schedule or time-table time, with the
same schedule rights, each carrying signals for
that following it, each several train is referred
to as a "section." Upon some roads these sections
following the first train are called
extra trains. This method is not recognized
under the "standard" rules, the
term "extra" being applied only to trains
not run by schedule. It is of great importance
that the rights of a second or other following
section be clearly understood, both by
trainmen and those engaged in the issue of
telegraphic orders. The general practice is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span>
now probably such as to leave but little misapprehension
on this point, whatever may have
been the case in the past, when with some the
rule was to "follow the flag" wherever it
might go, instead of as now treating each section,
in ascertaining its rights, as though it
were running alone on the schedule. When a
regular train is to carry signals to denote that
a second section is to follow on the same
schedule, the author is of the opinion that a
train order to this effect should be given in a
definite form.</p>

<p>Rule 110 of the "Standard" rules appears
to authorize the practice that prevails with
some, under which the signals for freight
trains running in sections are ordered on by
the yard dispatcher or station agent. If the
train Dispatcher is duly advised, there does
not seem to be any serious objection to this,
although there are reasons to be urged in favor
of all orders affecting the movement of trains
being issued from the central office. Certainly
it would not be wise to delegate this
authority as respects passenger trains, and this
the "Standard" rules recognize.</p>

<p>The forms given for sections make the order
to carry signals equivalent to an order to run
as a section of a regular train. The order
annulling a section implies that signals will be
removed as the circumstances may require.</p>

<p>Forms for arranging schedules were not suggested
in the former edition of The Train
Wire, and their use has not been very general.
They appear to be adapted to some special
circumstances and wants, but in the adoption
of the "Standard" rules some roads have
omitted a portion of the provisions under
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51158/51158-h/51158-h.htm#Form_G">Form G.</a></p>

<p>No particular remarks need be made respecting
these forms, excepting perhaps that
we have here an introduction of the time feature
and that any risk from this is enhanced
by the considerable number of "times" to be
sent by telegraph and observed by trainmen.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_H" name="Form_H">Form H.</a>—Extra Trains.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">---- will run extra from —— to ——.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>a.</i>) <i>Eng. 99 will run extra from Berber to Gaza.</i></p>

<p>A train receiving an order to run extra is not required to
guard against opposing extras, unless directed by order to
do so, but must keep clear of all regular trains, as required
by rule.</p>

<p>A "work train" is an extra, for which the above form will
be used for a direct run in one direction. The authority to
occupy a specified portion of the track, as an extra while
working, will be given in the following form:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>b.</i>) <i>Eng. 292 will work as an extra from 7 A. M. until 6 P.
M. between Berne and Turin.</i></p>

<p>The working limits should be as short as practicable, to be
changed as the progress of the work may require. The above
may be combined, thus:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>c.</i>) <i>Eng. 292 will run extra from Berne to Turin and
work as an extra from 7 A. M. until 6 P. M. between Turin
and Rome.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">« 121 »</a></span></p>

<p>When an order has been given to "work" between designated
points, no other extra must be authorized to run over
that part of the track without provision for passing the
work train.</p>

<p>When it is anticipated that a work train may be where it
cannot be reached for meeting or passing orders, it may be
directed to report for orders at a given time and place, or an
order may be given that it shall clear the track for a designated
extra in the following form:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>d.</i>) <i>Work train 292 will keep clear of Extra 223, south, between
Antwerp and Brussels after 2.10 P. M.</i></p>

<p>In this case, extra 223 must not pass either of the points
named before 2.10 P. M., at which time the work train must
be out of the way between those points.</p>

<p>When the movement of an extra train over the working
limits cannot be anticipated by these or other orders
to the work train, an order must be given to such extra,
to protect itself against the work train, in the following
form:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>e.</i>) <i>Extra 76 will protect itself against work train extra
95 between Lyons and Paris.</i></p>

<p>This may be added to the order to run extra.</p>

<p>A work train when met or overtaken by an extra must allow
it to pass without unnecessary detention.</p>

<p>When the conditions are such that it may be considered
desirable to require that work trains shall at all times protect
themselves while on working limits, this may be done
under the following arrangements. To example (<i>b</i>) add the
following words:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>f.</i>) <i>protecting itself against all trains</i>.</p>

<p>A train receiving this order must, whether standing or
moving, protect itself within the working limits (and in both
directions on single track) against all trains, in the manner
provided in Rule 99.</p>

<p>When an extra receives orders to run over working limits
it must be advised that the work train is within those limits
by adding to example (<i>a</i>) the words:</p>

<p class="p8">(<i>g.</i>) <i>Eng. 202 is working as an extra between Berne and
Turin.</i></p>

<p>A train receiving this order must run expecting to find the
work train within the limits named.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span></p>

<p>Under Form H it has been undertaken to
cover the whole subject of orders for extra
trains, excepting for cases which come naturally
under other forms, as when an extra is
ordered to meet another train.</p>

<p>The term "wild" has been quite extensively
used for these trains, and history should preserve
the fact that on some roads, when a train
was ordered to run extra, it was directed to
"wildcat."</p>

<p>An order for a train to run extra is very
simple. The train is accurately designated by
the number or name of its engine, and the order
reading as in example (<i>a</i>) is the foundation
for those which follow.</p>

<p>This is of course not a duplicate order. But
one train is concerned, and there is no other
train to be notified until it becomes necessary
to forward the extra by meeting or other orders.
In those it is described as an extra and treated
as any other train, but in the meantime it
must keep out of the way of all regular trains,
and the Dispatcher must keep it in hand and
especially guard against having more than one
extra on the same part of the track at the same
time. Here is an element of danger where the
necessities require frequent extra trains.
Whenever practicable, trains should be run
on a regular schedule, but it will often happen
that there is no regular train upon which signals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
may be carried for a train that must be
run, and it must go as an extra.</p>

<p>A precaution which has been found valuable
is for the Dispatcher to have before him a
large blackboard on which he shall place conspicuously
the number of each extra ordered.
The habit, soon acquired, of looking at this
whenever an extra is ordered, has proved a sufficient
safeguard where this plan has been used.</p>

<p>There is a class of extras which cannot be
dispensed with, and the management of which
gives rise to serious difficulty. These are the
material or "work" trains. These trains must
work upon the track away from stations, often
with a large force of men, and delays to their
operations cause expense as well as hindrance
to work. At the same time they must not be
permitted to interfere with the passage of regular
trains, nor of others more than can be
avoided. The solving of this problem has been
attempted in various ways. Some allow the
"work train" to occupy the track by right,
except that it must keep out of the way of
regular trains. Some permit it to work under
flag "until freight trains come in sight." To
get it out of the way for any but regular trains,
the want must be anticipated, and an order
given while it is within reach for the work
train to report for orders at a designated hour
and place. This plan does not give as complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
control of the movements of the work
train as is desirable.</p>

<p>A plan which has commended itself during
long use, and is presented in the foregoing
rules, is as follows: The work train, previous
to starting out for the day, receives an order to
run extra to the part of road where its work
lies. At the same time, and, if convenient, in
the same order, it is authorized to work upon
the part of the track desired, between two contiguous
telegraph stations, a specified time
being added, if convenient, at which the train
will have to go to one of the offices limiting
the working ground, for further instructions,
if it is foreseen that it may be wanted about
that time for this purpose. Confining the
working limits between two contiguous telegraph
stations leaves the smallest practicable
part of the track beyond complete control.
This practically makes a section of the track
for the time being a "yard," through which
extras cannot pass without looking for yard
engines, as is usually provided where yard
rules include a portion of the main track.</p>

<p>The rules provide two methods for operating
"work train" on the section assigned, a note
by the Time Convention committee indicating
that either or both may be adopted, according
to circumstances. One of these requires
the train to protect itself against all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
trains; the other allows it to work without
protection, and requires extras to look out
for it and protect themselves against it, after
receiving notice as to where it is working.
Under the first plan the work train is
required to keep signals out at all times for its
protection, and in running to either limit of
its working ground to fully protect itself
against any extra which might come. It is of
course required to keep clear of all regular
trains, and when running to or from its working
ground is provided with such meeting-orders
as may be required. Under this plan,
if the Dispatcher finds it necessary to send an
extra over the working grounds, he informs it
in the order that the work train is there (<i>g</i>).
This furnishes a precaution in addition to the
signals of the work train, and the proceeding
is entirely safe. It can be no less so than the
practice of working under flag in the time of a
delayed regular freight train until it appears
in sight, and this plan seems to afford an
entirely practicable method for working these
trains with the least interference with their
work and with other trains, and with entire
safety.</p>

<p>Under the plan by which the work train is
under no requirement to use any precautions
to protect itself on working ground, if another
extra is to pass over that ground there is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
the notice to such extra of the presence of the
work train, and the necessity of protecting
against it. This may be sufficient with a clear
view, but there are many circumstances where
the double precaution would seem to be best,
as the requirement that signals shall be kept a
given distance ahead of a moving train is
scarcely likely to be fully complied with. The
plan in which the work train is required to
protect itself is not to be viewed as a case of
divided responsibility, in which each party
may depend on the other. The requirement
for the work train is absolute. An extra getting
a notice as to where the work train is employed
is not required to protect itself. Such notice
would lead to keeping the train under greater
control and looking for the signals of the work
train, and whether the rule is that the work
train shall protect itself or not it would be best
to give such notice, as this would enable extras
to run with confidence and without protection
against the work train on parts of the road
where it was not employed.</p>

<p>As to which of the methods provided by the
rule shall be used, this must depend somewhat
upon circumstances. Where the passing of an
extra train is very infrequent, the constant
putting out of signals by the work train would
seem to those charged with the duty so unnecessary
that they would be likely to neglect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
it, and it would be better under such circumstances
to require extras to protect when orders
cannot be given. When extras are so frequent
that the loss of time in protecting themselves
would be very serious, it would be better to
put the duty on the work train. There would
be the advantage then of the daily habit on the
part of those attending to this duty.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_J" name="Form_J">Form J.</a>—Holding Order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">Hold ——.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p class="p8">(1) <i>Hold No. 2.</i></p>

<p class="p8">(2) <i>Hold all trains east.</i></p>

<p>As any order for which "O K" has been given and acknowledged
operates as a holding order for the train to which it is
addressed, this form will only be used in special cases to
hold trains until orders can be given or for some other
emergency. The reason for holding may be added, as "for
orders."</p>

<p>This order is not to be used for holding a train while orders
are given to other trains against it which are not at the
same time given to it in duplicate. It must be respected by
conductors and enginemen of trains thereby directed to be
held as if addressed to them. Conductors, when informed of
the order, must sign for it, and their signatures must be sent
and "complete" obtained.</p>

<p>When a train has been so held it must not go until the
order to hold is annulled, or an order is given in the form:</p>

<p class="p8">"—— <i>may go</i>."</p>

<p>This must be addressed to the person or persons to whom
the order to hold was addressed, and must be delivered in
the same manner.</p>
</div>

<p>The rules and explanations under this form
are so complete that comment as to the design
and significance of the order is unnecessary.
In view of much former practice, too much importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
cannot be attached to the provision
relating to what the holding order shall <i>not</i> be
used for.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Form_K" name="Form_K">Form K.</a>—Annulling a Schedule Train.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">---- of —— is annulled.</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p class="p8">(1) <i>No. 1 of Feb. 29th is annulled.</i></p>

<p class="p8">(2) <i>No. 3, due to leave Naples Saturday, Feb. 29th, is
annulled.</i></p>

<p>Adding "<i>from Alaska</i>," or "<i>between Alaska and Halifax</i>,"
when appropriate.</p>

<p>This order takes away all rights of the train annulled and
authorizes any train or person receiving it to use the track
as if the train annulled were not on the time-table.</p>

<p>If a train is annulled to a point named, its rights beyond
that point remain unaffected.</p>

<p>The Train Dispatcher may direct any operator to omit repeating
back an order annulling a train, until he has occasion
to deliver it.</p>

<p>When a train has been annulled it must not be again restored
under its original number by special order.</p>
</div>

<p>As this is a general order, which may or may
not have to be delivered to trains at all telegraph
stations, it is very properly provided
that repeating back at once by each office need
not be insisted upon.</p>

<p>The restoration of an annulled train under
its original number would tend to confusion,
and the impropriety of such action is here
recognized.</p>

<p>When a train is annulled it naturally follows
that orders previously issued to it cease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span>
to be of effect and the Dispatcher must see
that the duplicates of such orders, held by
other trains, are annulled, if from not doing so
confusion or delay would arise. Ordinarily
the order annulling the train would be sufficient,
if sent to trains holding these orders. If
a section of a train is annulled it would seem
that the same general rule should apply. The
"Standard" rules do not touch on this and it
would be difficult to frame and operate a rule
upon any other than the plan pointed out. It
may be suggested that orders held by the annulled
section should be transferred to the
section following it, and which, by the rules,
takes its place. This would be convenient in
some cases and when so might be directed;
but there may be no following section, and,
if there is, the circumstances may have so
changed since the orders were issued as to
render them inapplicable. The transfer of
orders without the usual precautions to ensure
their correct reception is objectionable and it
is best to avoid it when not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The better way is no doubt to leave to the
Dispatcher the disposition of orders issued for
a train afterward annulled, whether such train
be a section or otherwise. It would have been
well if the "Standard" rules had made some
explicit declaration on this point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p8">Order No. —— is annulled.</p>

<p>This will be numbered, transmitted, and signed for as other
orders.</p>

<p>If an order which is to be annulled has not been delivered
to a train, the annulling order will be addressed to the
operator, who will destroy all copies of the order annulled
but his own, and write on that:</p>

<p class="p8"><i>Annulled by order No.</i> ——.</p>

<p>An order superseding another may be given, adding, "<i>this
supersedes order No.</i> ——," or adding, "<i>instead of</i> ——."</p>


<p class="pmt2 center">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p class="p8"><i>No. 1 and No. 2 will meet at Sparta instead of at Thebes.</i></p>

<p>An order which includes more than one specified movement
must not be superseded.</p>

<p>An order that has been annulled or superseded must not be
again restored by Special Order under its original number.</p>

<p>In the address of an order annulling or superseding another
order, the train first named must be that to which rights
were given by the order annulled or superseded, and when
the order is not transmitted simultaneously to all concerned
it must be sent to the point at which that train is to receive
it and the required response first given, before the order is
sent for other trains.</p>
</div>

<p>The annulling order is here properly made
subject to all the safeguards adopted for orders
directing the movements of trains, and placed
by its number in the series with them. Superseding
one order by another without the previous
process of annulling is here provided for
with the important provision that this method
shall not be used for an order including more
than one specified movement. It would seldom
be applicable to such a case, and if it were it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
might tend to confusion, so that it is better to
annul the whole order and give new instructions
in separate orders.</p>

<p>The provision that an annulled order shall
not be restored under its original number is
quite necessary to avoid the confusion which
might arise under the opposite course. The
requirement as to priority in transmission of
this order is important, in view of the fact that
orders reverse the rights of trains, and the
reason here is the same as that which obtains
in the original transmission.</p>

<p>The Time Convention rules prescribe the
forms, etc., for the blanks on which train
orders are to be written. These forms are here
shown, with the specifications for the manifold-books.</p>

<p>Some slight changes have been made in these
by roads adopting them, but in all essential
features they have not been departed from, so
far as the author is aware.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">GENERAL REMARKS.</p>

<p class="caption4"><span class="smcap">Rules as to Rights of Track.</span></p>


<p>The respective rights of trains are frequently
spoken of in what has gone before. Any
method of dispatching must be subject to
modification in some of the details to accord
with the particular rules of the road governing
train rights. A great deal of ingenuity
has been expended in constructing such rules,
with a view to avoiding delay to trains under
all imagined circumstances. Trains to which
the superior right of track has been assigned
have been required to wait at meeting-points
twenty, thirty or more minutes, and changing
or movable rights have been connected with
this, and allowances have been made for "variation
in watches." These devices may occasionally
prove useful, and rules are necessary
to govern the trains in the most of their movements,
as the telegraph may sometimes be
out of order and at best cannot control the
general movements of trains as well as it can
be done by rule. But where the telegraph is
managed with anything like the perfection now
possible, the occasions are few upon which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">« 136 »</a></span>
is unavailable for any long time; and whatever
may have been the seeming necessity formerly
for complicated rules and time allowances, it
would seem that these may now be greatly
simplified, as has in fact been done in the
"Standard" rules.</p>

<p>These rules provide that all trains running
in one direction, specified on the time-table,
shall have absolute right of track over opposing
trains of the same class, the rule being entirely
without complication by time allowance
for clearance.</p>

<p>This is exceedingly simple and interposes no
difficulties in ascertaining the respective rights
of these trains. The precaution is observed of
requiring superior trains to stop at schedule
meeting-points unless the switches are seen to
be right and the track clear, and to run cautiously,
prepared to stop at other points where
a train may be met that has not been met at a
schedule meeting-point. This, however, adds
no complication to the rule.</p>

<p>For trains of different classes it is simply
arranged that those of any class shall clear the
main track five minutes before the time of those
of a superior class.</p>

<p>It is not within the plan of this work to enter
upon a full discussion of the various methods
of arranging train rights. It is only insisted
that the rules should be simple. This not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
tends to safety in their ordinary operation,
but greatly simplifies the work of train dispatching
and removes the risks to which this
work is subjected by a complicated system of
train rules. The reduction of the amount of
mental effort required of the Dispatcher, in
determining what aid he shall give to trains by
special orders, reduces the risk of his making
mistakes in the preparation of these orders, and
the simplicity here urged is in the direct line
of the work of the Time Convention committee
in the preparation of the "Standard" rules.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Numbering Switches.</span></p>

<p>Of those matters fixed by the train rules
which directly affect the train dispatching,
few are more important than the arrangements
which determine how trains meeting shall pass
each other. It is usually understood and provided
that, when trains meet, those having the
right of track shall keep the main track, with
sometimes an exception to this in favor of
trains which cannot go on the siding without
backing. Where this latter provision exists it
renders it unnecessary for either train to pass
the switch in the face of the other when they
are to meet at a siding open only at one end.
It is sometimes, however, necessary to put a
superior train on the siding for a train that is
too heavy or too long to go on, or for some
other reason. The train order must settle this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
but this usually adds to its length. The following
provision has been found to entirely
meet the case:</p>

<p>At each siding or group of switches the main
track switches are numbered from No. 1, and
the numbers, all running in the same general
direction, are painted on the switch signals
with the initial letter of the station or siding.
For instance, at the London passing siding the
northernmost switch will be marked L 1, and
the southernmost L 2. An order is given requiring
trains No. 1 and No. 2 to meet at London,
and it is desired to put the superior train,
No. 1, going north, on the siding. The order
would then read:</p>

<p class="center"><i>No. 1 and No. 2 will meet at London No. 2.</i></p>

<p>Train No. 2 may then run to switch No. 2
on the main track, and train No. 1 can go no
farther. It is a physical impossibility for the
trains to pass at that switch without No. 1
going on the siding, which it would do without
question under the operation of a rule
requiring that <i>when trains meet on orders the
train shall take the siding which can do so
without backing</i>. This simple arrangement
indicates also which siding is to be used
at a station having several. It economizes
telegraphing very much and is perfectly definite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span></p>

<p>This plan is especially valuable when the
arrangement of sidings is not of the most
simple character, or when three or more trains
are to meet or pass at the same point, at or
near the same time. The simplicity with which
the placing of the trains is effected leaves nothing
to be desired. Each goes to its own place
without hesitation or loss of time.</p>

<p>In all railroad operations we now see increased
attention given to minute details. To
this is due much of the marvelous advance in
every department. This is especially evident
in all mechanical appliances. It is very apparent
in the construction of the "Standard"
Rules.</p>

<p>The suggestion here brought forward is in
this direction. Instead of directing trains to
meet at a given station where there may be
doubt as to the exact point, leaving them to ascertain
on arrival which switch is to be used
or which siding is clear, this plan gives in the
order the precise point and also conveys the
information as to which train will take the
siding. This suggestion, made in the earlier
edition of this work, has been adopted only to
a very limited extent, so far as the author is
aware. He is so fully convinced of its value
that he feels like urging its careful consideration.
To fully carry out the plan, those using
the "Standard" rules would have to add the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
provision above indicated requiring those
trains to take the siding which can do so
without backing.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Double Track.</span></p>

<p>With more than one track the business of
train dispatching is usually little more than to
keep slow trains out of the way of faster ones.
The protection of trains unexpectedly stopped
from trains following, may be effected by the
"block system" in use on many of our best
roads.</p>

<p>Single track work may be needed when one
of the tracks is blocked, but unfortunately the
men engaged on double track do not become
familiar with the methods for single track, and
cannot usually operate them satisfactorily in
emergencies.</p>

<p>The use of the opposite tracks for laying off
trains is frequently practiced, but usually under
the protection of signals only. Where
there are two, three or four tracks a much
more extended use of them might be made for
passing trains around each other, by the adoption
of the methods for single track train dispatching,
with good results in the saving of
sidings and in keeping heavy trains moving,
and it is not improbable that expenditure for
additional tracks might sometimes be postponed
for considerable periods by the proper
adaptation of the telegraph. There would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
seem to be here an opportunity for managers to
keep down their capital account by increasing
the capacity of their tracks by the addition of
a wire. That this has not been done in many
cases may have been owing to the slow advance
of the science of train dispatching in past
years, or perhaps to limited information on the
part of railroad owners and officers as to its
capabilities. It is certainly true that single
track roads with siding facilities none too good
are now doing an amount of business that not
many years ago would have been thought to
imperatively demand additional tracks.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Telegraphic train dispatching came with the
telegraph. The first attempts were very
crude. As late as the year 1865, on one of our
most important railroads, the plan was for any
conductor to telegraph from a station where
he might be, to the conductor of an opposing
train at the next station, stating when he
would leave, and where he would meet the
other. When the two came to an understanding
they went ahead.</p>

<p>The early orders, in the attempt to render
them more secure, were often obscured by accumulated
cautions as to how to run, and by
general directions. To undertake now to give
the historical facts of those early days would
require more research than the author has
been able to give, and might involve controversy
into which he does not care to enter. It
appears likely that methods nearly like the
present "single order" were the earliest tried,
and these seem to have been more widely
used than the "duplicate." The latter was
at least not long behind the other. It was
originated and carefully worked up in several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span>
independent quarters, and from these it has
been adopted by others. The author has
never used any other method. Adopting it
in 1863, it was in use for some years before he
was aware that others were in the same path,
who may have commenced at a still earlier
date.</p>

<p>The closing paragraph of the first edition of
this work was as follows:</p>

<p>"This method is growing in favor, and one
object of the author will have been attained if
this discussion shall aid in promoting its general
adoption."</p>

<p>In preparing this second edition the fact
has constantly appeared that the former words
of recommendation related to points which are
now realized facts on a majority of our railroads
and that the method then urged has
now reached the then desired position of
"general adoption."</p>

<p>The author cannot take leave of his subject
without a special word to railroad managers.
No "system" has yet been devised, or ever
will be, that will work itself. Rules cannot
be given to men with the expectation that
they will take them up, master their principles
and operate them satisfactorily, especially
in so important a matter as that under discussion,
without careful instruction and intelligent
supervision on the part of those who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
from their official position, are responsible
for the results. A superintendent who is
not himself particularly informed respecting
the rules and methods of his telegraph
department, the character and capabilities
of the men employed, and the manner in
which their duties are performed, cannot
expect to secure the advantages which the
telegraph is capable of giving. Perhaps the
first public intimation that anything is wrong
may be a series of so-called "accidents"
on his line. Investigation points to the carelessness
of some operator or dispatcher as the
cause. Deeper probing would perhaps discover
that such carelessness was the natural
consequence of lack of constant and painstaking
supervision. Besides securing for such
particular supervision a competent and trustworthy
person whose special business it should
be, the superintendent can never get away from
the necessity of constantly impressing upon
such official the responsibilities of his position,
discussing with him the details of the work,
and seeing, at least occasionally, with his own
eyes, how it is performed.</p>

<p>The telegraph may be viewed as holding to
the railroad a relation analogous to that of the
nervous system to the body. From the center
of authority and intelligence it carries information
and instructions to every member. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
keeps in motion the whole body, which, without
this, would be in a measure lifeless. Its
ceaseless and healthful activity is all-important;
and as failure of the nervous energy is to
the human frame, so to the railroad is a falling
off in the vital force operating through the train
wire. A tonic is needed and perhaps a change
of doctors.</p>

<p>The author's duties for some time have not
brought him into direct connection with the
operation of trains, and he will probably
never again be engaged in this department of
railroad work.</p>

<p>His interest in it, however, is unabated, and
his desire that the methods he has endeavored
to set forth shall meet with enlarged usefulness,
until better shall be found, has led him to
this second effort to present what has been
his study during the most of his business life,
and now leads him to urge upon those now actively
engaged in this work that the "price"
of success, as of "liberty," is "eternal vigilance."</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br>
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
