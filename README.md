Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

part1:
I choose 3 gutenberg stories there in html form in the folder of part1.
I set h1 bold, uppercase, and also center in the page.
I set h1 h2 h3 h4 are same font-family.
I set all the imgages which come with the html file as height 30% and width 30% hence if we change the window size it will auto-change. the images will not that big or small when we see the webpage.
I set the p's font-family as verdana, font-size 14px and make indent 2em hence when we read it, it will lile a book style. 
I set a background image as the background to make it looks like a old role book. 
I make the background image full screen and when we roll the window up and down it will follow which is the method fix.
I set the table font-weight blod and margin-right and left as auto it will put in the middle of the page because most the table are the contents
I set the blockquote and the p in side blickquote's font-size as 10px it iwll smaller then the normal p hence the reader know that it is quotation.
I set the pre as color as grey and italic to let reader know that it is not the part of the article it just the writer's infor or something
